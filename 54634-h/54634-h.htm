<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c012'>In the spring of 1906 we found ourselves with three
months to devote to foreign travel, and after some
deliberation we decided to spend them in exploring those
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Iles oubliées</i></span>” of the Mediterranean—Majorca, Minorca,
and Iviza—and in ascertaining for ourselves whether they
were worth visiting and what were the possibilities of a
stay there.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their names, it is true, lingered in our memories like
some familiar echo from far-off schoolroom days, but with
regard to all practical details we were extremely ignorant,
and it was without knowing a soul in the islands or a
soul who had ever been there, that we set out on the last
day of January to visit the Balearics—those homes of
famous slingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>A railway journey of twenty-two hours takes the
traveller from Paris to Barcelona by way of Toulouse.
The change from France to Spain is an abrupt one. After
racing through flat lands of vine, through sand dunes and
salt lagoons, one crosses the frontier into a dry place of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>red and orange hills, where stone villages stand bare and
unshrinking in the strong sunlight, and here and there a
palm—solitary outpost of the south—waves her dusty
plumes; and the night falls suddenly upon a sky crystal
clear, as the sun slips in glory behind the strong outline
of the purple Pyrenees.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>An old writer has left it on record that the thing which
chiefly repented him in his life was having gone anywhere
by sea when he might have gone by land. Since it is
decreed, however, that islands shall be reached by water,
one subject of remorse was spared us as we boarded the
steamship <i>Miramar</i> at half-past six on the evening of
February 5th. And so great is the power of comparatives
to cheer, that though the worst of sailors, we derived a
certain happiness from the reflection that we had at any
rate chosen the lesser evil in sailing from Barcelona instead
of taking the twenty-four hour crossing from Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Behold us then at dawn gliding into the Bay of Palma
and gazing around us with that undefined expectancy
that even in these prosaic days of travel tinges with
romance the landing on an unknown shore.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Here is nothing of the wild and rugged mountain
scenery that meets the eye on approaching Ajaccio.
Rather like some Fortunate Isle safe from the reach of
tempests does Majorca lie serene and dreaming upon the
water. The great bay opening to the south is enclosed
upon the east by a level shore terminating far out at sea
in the blue headland of Cape Blanco, while closer at hand
the western coast line is indented with many a rocky
promontory and wooded headland curving down to the
harbour’s rim. A low cliff of orange sandstone encircles
like a sea wall the head of the bay, and upon this cliff
stands Palma, a sea of colourless houses massed upon the
water’s edge and stretching backwards to the wide plain—deep
blue and level well-nigh as the sea itself—that
forms the background to the town and to the great
cathedral that towers high above all other buildings.</p>

<p class='c013'>At its eastern rim the plain rises slightly to the double
peaks of the Puig de Randa, far inland; on the west the
panorama is closed by a distant range of sapphire blue
mountains, the Sierra of the interior.</p>

<p class='c013'>We land, and are rattled quickly away in an omnibus
to the Grand Hotel—but a few minutes distant from the
quay. It was no small relief to find that we were spared
a further encounter with the Spanish <i>douane</i>, for the
ruthless violation of our trunks at the frontier station
of Port Bou was still fresh in our memory, while the
very hour of our sailing from Barcelona had been marked
by a last attempt at extortion. A Customs official who
was patrolling the wharf in all the glory of helmet and
sword, took upon himself to detain a packing case of ours,
containing a saddle, and, on the ground that he could not
see what was inside, he forbade it to be put on board.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was late—it was dark—the boat was about to sail,
and we had retired to our cabin. Our hired porter raved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and shrieked upon the quay, then came to us and said
we must have the case opened or it would be left behind.
I stumbled upstairs again, my Spanish deserting me at
such a rate that by the time I reached the shore my
vocabulary was literally reduced to the one word, <i>sombrero</i>—which,
unhappily, did not bear upon the matter. The
<i>douanier</i> was polite, but firm. With shrugged shoulders
he said the Senorita would comprehend that with the best
will in the world he could not see through a deal board.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that moment the gleam of a street lamp fell upon an
upturned palm protruding from beneath the military
cape—and into it I slipped a peseta, which produced such
a furious access of shrugging and protestation that for
one brief moment I thought I had insulted the man. But
on looking round I saw that all was well, porter and case
being already half-way on deck—and with a sense of deep
annoyance at having tipped a person I would willingly
have fined, I followed them and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the Palma quay all is peace. By a simple arrangement
involving a certain annual subsidy to the Customs
officials, the proprietor of the Grand Hotel has ensured
protection for his guests’ luggage, which escapes even the
most nominal examination. The hotel omnibus merely
draws up for a moment in front of the <i>Douane</i> on entering
the town; the officials, armed with long probing
rods, saunter out, open the carriage door and wish us
good day—and on we go again.</p>

<p class='c013'>The town is still half asleep, and as we drive up to
the hotel its shutters are being unshipped by yawning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>faquins. We find a large and handsome five-storied
building with an imposing façade, and balconied windows
that look out upon the small central square of the town.
The interior conveys a truly southern impression of
silence and space, due to the great expanses of marble
pavement and to the cool stone walls and passages which
prevent the conveyance of sound. The dining hall is
immense; so are the lobbies that run round the central
well of the house, and off which the bedrooms open.
We go upstairs, and within an hour of our arrival have
become <i>pensionnaires</i> of the hotel at 10s. a head a day,
and are installed in two excellent rooms on the third
floor, comfortably furnished, fitted with electric bells and
light, heated by hot water, and reached by a lift, while
our wants are being ministered to by a cheerful white-capped
chambermaid answering to the name of Dolores.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>With brains still jumbled by travel it is almost impossible
to realise, in the midst of such up-to-date comfort,
that we are really and actually in Majorca—an island
that might, for all we knew to the contrary a few weeks
ago, have proved an inhospitable rock. Memories recur of
nights spent <i>en route</i> at Paris and Toulouse, and we go
to the window half-expecting to see a vista of wide boulevards
and to hear the familiar clanging of electric trams
as they glide up and down some arcaded street of cafés
and shopfronts.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>We are sharply recalled from such visions: a sea of
pale yellow-ochre tiles, unbroken, though intersected by
narrow crevasse-like streets, stretches down to a strip of
brilliant blue water in the harbour below. On flat
house tops lines of wet linen flap wildly in sun and wind.
Jutting up above the mass of irregular roofs are fantastic
turrets and aviaries, painted blue and red, the homes of
innumerable pigeons now wheeling in flocks over the
town, their wings singing as they cleave the air above
our heads. From scattered belfrys and towers unmelodious
bells clash out wildly for a few moments
and then relapse into silence; and like a running
accompaniment to the murmur of the streets is heard
the gobble, gobble of many turkeys, and the bright eye
of one of these birds is seen watching us fixedly through
the Venetian shutters of a small upper room across the
way. No, truly! this is all very unlike a northern city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Majorca is in fact a stepping-stone between Europe
and Africa, where the East and West—rather than the
north and south of her geographical position—may be
said to meet.</p>

<p class='c013'>She has had many masters in her day: the earliest
colonists of whom we have any record were the sea-faring
Rhodians, who were said to build “as though for
eternity.” But not the faintest trace of their occupation
survives. Their successors were the Carthaginians, who
left footprints in Minorca by founding Mahon, the capital,
the reputed birthplace of Hannibal. Then came the
Romans, who in 123 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> founded Palma and Pollensa;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Balearic slingers fought under Julius Cæsar in Gaul as
they had done under Hannibal at Cannæ. Five hundred
years later the islands were captured by the Vandals—were
retaken by the Byzantine general Belisarius, and
fell subsequently with the greater part of Spain into the
hands of the Visigoths.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the eighth century came the resistless tide of the
Saracens, who held the island for an uninterrupted
period of nearly five hundred years, and might have kept
it longer had they not strained the patience of their
Christian neighbours to breaking point by their piratical
habits. They had become such a menace to the marine
commerce of Europe that the then Pope preached a
crusade against the Balearic bandits, and an allied fleet
sailed from Pisa and Catalonia in the twelfth century.
The pirates’ nest was smoked out, Palma succumbing
after a long and stubborn siege. The allies, however,
proved unable to retain their prize, and the island
relapsed to the Moors, who so far took their lesson to
heart as to somewhat amend their ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the great assault was yet to come. On Sept. 6,
1229, Don Jaime I—King of Aragon and Count of
Barcelona—destined to live in history by the title of
<i>El Conquistador</i>, set sail for Palma with 150 galleys and
18,000 soldiers, besides a great company of Spanish
knights aflame with religious zeal, the lust of conquest,
and the hope of glory. We are told that the Christian
host encountered a great storm on the way, and that
they were grievously sick before they landed near Porto
Pi to the west of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Here the infidels attacked them, but were beaten back
and besieged within the city, which fell some three
months later after a desperate resistance, and was entered
by the victorious Spanish army on December 31, 1229.</p>

<p class='c013'>From that memorable day may be said to date modern
Palma. Everything around one testifies to the break
that separates the history of the town since the conquest
from the old period of Arab domination. The names of
the streets immortalise the Conqueror and succeeding
sovereigns or notables of the invading race. The
scutcheons that ornament the public buildings display the
arms granted to Palma by Don Jaime—a castle in the
sea, with a palm-tree issuant, quartered with the arms of
Aragon and surmounted by the Bat, cognisance of the
Counts of Barcelona.</p>

<p class='c013'>The town houses of the aristocracy are the old palaces
of the nine noble families whose ancestors accompanied
the Conqueror and settled in the island. The Governor’s
residence stands where did the Moorish sheikh’s palace;
the Cathedral occupies the site of the principal mosque.
So thorough were the invaders in destroying or converting
to other uses the Moorish buildings, so fierce was their
Christian zeal—“which spared not even stones”—that
hardly a trace remains of the oriental Palma, that city
crowned with minarets and peopled with 80,000 souls,
which attained under the Moors a glory and magnificence
that have never since been equalled.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The Palma of the present day is a prosperous town of
some 60,000 inhabitants. She has burst her ancient
limits, and her eastern outskirts are thick with factories
and windmills extending to the plain, while outside her
western fortifications has sprung up a large residential
suburb, and the wooded slopes above the bay are thronged
for miles with villas and summer residences. Only the
town that lies inside the walls is the old Palma, and this—in
its main features—has probably altered little since
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>A wide thoroughfare divides the town into the upper
and lower <i>Villas</i>, and starting from the harbour, takes a
right angle near the Grand Hotel and makes its exit
through the Porte Jésus in the north-west walls. This
is the principal artery of the town, and was originally—like
the Rambla of many another Spanish city—the bed
by which the river found its way to the sea; but in the
year 1403 a disastrous flood, causing the loss of hundreds
of houses and lives, so alarmed the inhabitants that the
river was turned from its course and conducted into the
moat that surrounds the town. Spanish rivers are proverbial
for their lack of water, and it is difficult to credit
the Riéra—which in its normal state suggests nothing
more dangerous than a gravel pit after rain—with such
powers of destruction in bygone days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gigantic scale of Palma’s encircling fortifications
may perhaps best be realised by a glance at the accompanying
picture, where the Riéra is seen flowing beneath
the bridge that leads from the gate of Santa Catalina to
the suburb of the same name.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The fortifications date from very different periods.
The completed design of moat and rampart as it now
stands was originated in the sixteenth century and
only finished a hundred years ago; but remains of
the old Moorish defences still exist, though they
suffered severely in the great siege of 1229, and were
strengthened and largely rebuilt by the Spanish conquerors.</p>

<p class='c013'>A picturesque gateway on the north of the town, now
called Santa Margarita, but dubbed by the Moors the
Gate of the Christians, is pointed out as having been the
one by which Don Jaime made his triumphant entry
into Palma. This gateway, like the other survivals of
the ancient fortifications, stands some way within the
<i>Muralla</i> of the present day, which encompasses the
town as with a raised highway—one might almost say a
common, so incredibly vast are the earthworks within
the walls. Hither the townsfolk ascend at evening to
enjoy the sea breeze and the glorious view over land
and sea. Cows graze peacefully along the ramparts,
surrounded by children at play; and wheeling flights of
pigeons execute aerial manœuvres overhead, while squads
of new recruits march unendingly backwards and forwards
from morning to night in the dry bed of the moat
below, and the bastions re-echo the sharp words of
command.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moat on the eastern side is devoted to rope-making,
and there men are seen walking backwards all
day long, spinning as they go, and the dull thud of heavy
mallets is heard as they beat out the bundles of esparto
grass.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>On the southern ramparts overlooking the harbour and
immediately beneath the cathedral, is the broad terraced
walk that forms Palma’s most beautiful promenade. At
intervals along the low parapet stand ancient sentry-boxes
of weathered sandstone, and one looks past them
out to sea, with a bird’s-eye view of the harbour and its
shipping backed by the white suburb of Santa Catalina
and the pinewoods of Bellver. Above us rise clustered
houses, with here and there a group of slender palm-trees
leaning from some garden, and crowning all stands
the great cathedral, rich with pinnacles and flying
buttresses, and turning to the harbour a cliff-like face of
sandstone deep tanned by centuries of sun and sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Small wonder that the townspeople love to stroll on
their beautiful <i>Muralla de Mar</i>. It is probably the only
portion of the ramparts that will survive the work of
destruction now proceeding—for the doom of the fortifications
is sealed. The last part they played in history
was during the Spanish war of succession in 1715, when
Palma hotly espoused the cause of the Austrian archduke
and was reduced by General Aspheld with an army of
10,000 men. Modern science has rendered the old walls
useless as a defence—modern hygiene considers them an
undesirable barrier to fresh air.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so they are to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the last thirty years the work of pulling them down
has proceeded with but occasional pauses from lack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>funds. Already a wide breach has been made on the
side next the sea; to the north a large section of the
moat has been filled in and converted into a square with
gardens; and workmen are now engaged in throwing
down the eastern walls. The outer casing of masonry is
being gradually stripped off and the vast earthworks
shovelled into the moat. To the onlooker it seems as if
ants had been set to remove a mountain as he watches
one trolley-load of rubbish after another slide down to
the glacis below without making the slightest perceptible
difference.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet it is only a question of a few years before walls and
moat alike shall have vanished. Gone will be the old
entrance gates with their scutcheons and turrets and
their deep archways of black shadow where lurks the
<i>douanier</i> watching for his prey. Gone will be the bridges
with their ceaseless stream of passengers plying to and
from the town. Gone—alas! will be one of Palma’s
most picturesque features.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>A cheerful scene greets the eye of the stranger who
starts out on a voyage of exploration the morning after
his arrival at the Grand Hotel. Facing him, as he
emerges into the street, is the <i>Plaza del Mercádo</i>, lying
in the shadow of the old hexagonal tower of the church
of San Nicolas, and flanked by the great balconied house
of the Zafortéza family. If it happen to be a Saturday
morning a busy throng is congregated on the square;
the ground is strewn with displays of glass and crockery,
of coarse green and brown pottery and graceful waterjars,
while the sellers of young orange-trees, of toys and
jewellery, of cheap rocking chairs and folding trestle
bedsteads, vie with one another in attracting the attention
of possible purchasers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Long flights of steps lead to the higher part of the
town—some broad and shallow, the playground of innumerable
boys; others steep and so narrow that the tall
houses almost meet overhead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cobbled streets of the oldest and most aristocratic
quarters of Palma resemble ravines, and are barely wide
enough to admit of the passage of the heavy two-wheeled
carts that come lumbering through, scraping either wall
with their axles and compelling foot passengers to seek the
shelter of the nearest archway. An oriental atmosphere
of mystery hangs about the massive, fortress-like walls of
the great houses that tower on either side, turning to the
outer world a blank and inscrutable face of reserve that
offers not the faintest indication of the life existing
within. External windows are represented by a few
heavily-barred apertures high overhead, but if you chance
to find the great nail-studded <i>porte-cochère</i> standing open
you are at perfect liberty to go in and look about
you.</p>

<p class='c013'>The universal plan of all the better houses is that
inherited from the Arabs—of a <i>patio</i> or open courtyard
in the centre of the building, from which a staircase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>ascends to the dwelling rooms on the first floor. In
some houses this <i>patio</i> consists of nothing more than
a plain courtyard enclosed by whitewashed walls, with
perhaps a clump of bananas growing in the centre; but
in the palaces inhabited by the nobility and dating back
some centuries the courtyard is frequently of great
beauty and constitutes the chief architectural feature
of the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>The residence of the Oleza family in the <i>Calle de Moréy</i>
has a fine courtyard in Rénaissance style; handsome
pillars of red marble support the vaultings of the house,
and the gallery that spans the marble staircase rests upon
a wide flattened arch bearing the family coat of arms.
The ground floor is devoted to stables, coach-house, and
domestic offices, and in the court stands that characteristic
feature of Moorish and Spanish <i>patios</i>—the well,
from which the household draws its water supply. The
bucket is lowered from a wrought-iron support in the
form of a crozier, and on being brought up brimming its
contents are upset into the font-shaped receptacle of
stone close by, from which they flow through an orifice
into the water jar placed on a slab below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The palace of the Marquis de Vivot in the <i>Calle Zavella</i>
is not as ancient as many another, dating as it does from
the beginning of the eighteenth century only, but its
<i>patio</i> is the largest in Palma and certainly one of the
most beautiful. It is approached by fine <i>portes-cochères</i>
and has in the centre a paved space where carriages
stand at the foot of the great staircase. From eight
beautiful marble columns spring the graceful arches that
uphold the house, and in brilliant relief against the black
shadows of the recess stands out the clear red of two
immense oil-jars containing palms.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>I am not competent to enter into the details of wrought
work and sculpture with which the <i>patios</i> of Palma
abound, but even to the visitor unversed in architecture
a voyage of discovery in the older quarters is full
of interest. The meanest back street may produce a
richly-carved window frame or a staircase with a stone
balustrade of quaint and original design. The <i>Calle de
Sol</i> boasts a house front in purest Rénaissance style, five
big windows on the first floor being wreathed in gargoyles
and strange stone monsters.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>Calle de la Almudaina</i> we come upon an ancient
machicolated archway spanning the street. This once
formed part of the wall that encircled the very kernel
of the old Moorish city, and is the only survival of the
five gateways that afforded entrance to the Citadel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not far from here is the equally ancient Moorish Bath,
a small building some twenty feet square standing in an
orange garden. It is in the Byzantine style, and is built
of small bricks scarcely thicker than the intervening layers
of mortar. The circular basin which no doubt occupied
the floor of the building has disappeared, and the interior
contains nothing but twelve much-worn pillars standing
in a square, the eight centre ones supporting the cupola
of the roof, while the four corner columns are by an
ingenious—and I believe very unusual—arrangement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>omitted from the circle and left standing back in the
angles of the building.</p>

<p class='c013'>An air of incredible age pervades this blackened and
cobwebbed relic of Islamism that lingers, unaltered and
half forgotten, in the very heart of the Christian city.
It forms—with the Almudaina arch and the signal tower
of Porto Pi—the only authentic memorial of the race
which occupied Majorca for a period of five hundred
years.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The churches of Palma are many. One of the oldest
is that of Monte Sion, which is said to have adopted both
the site and the name of a still older Jewish synagogue:
as one skirts its walls, huge, blank, and dungeon-like,
one is quite unprepared for its exquisite doorway—one of
the richest pieces of sculpture in Palma. It is a fine
specimen of rococo, dating from 1683, and constituting
in its delicacy of detail and beauty of proportion one of
the finest of the many beautiful church doors for which
Palma is famed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely less magnificent is the west front of the great
church of San Francisco, with its immense doorway in
late Rénaissance style, surmounted by an exquisite rose
window. This church contains the tomb of a scion of a
noble Catalonian house—the famous Rámon Lull, warrior,
scholar, and saint—who in the reign of Jaime II. founded
a college for the instruction of twelve monks in oriental
tongues, and was himself martyred in Algeria by the
infidels whom he went forth to convert. His body was
secured by some Genoese fishermen, who set sail for
Italy with their precious burden; but when off the coast
of Majorca their boat refused to advance till the martyr’s
body was brought on shore, where it was laid to rest in
its native soil by the monks of San Francisco.</p>

marble, but the effigy of Rámon Lull, surrounded by
fretted canopies and fantastic heraldic beasts, is only
dimly visible in the deep gloom of the church.</p>

<p class='c013'>A trap door leads down to an immense crypt, where a
huddled-up human skeleton is pointed out and the story
told of a bloody tragedy enacted in the church in the year
1490. Two of Palma’s greatest families were at deadly
feud, and while attending the ceremonies of the <i>Jour des
Morts</i>, upon some slight pretext came to blows. The
church became a slaughter-house, and before swords were
sheathed more than three hundred dead and wounded
were left on the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whether the skeleton in the crypt is one of those that
fell that memorable day may be doubted; but it is not
improbable, for the church and its monastery were
founded shortly after the conquest—by monks of the
order of St. Francis of Assisi—and were from earliest
times one of the chief places of burial for the nobility.
The walls of the adjoining cloisters are thick with
scutcheons and memorial tablets to those who were once
the greatest in the land.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>A beautiful colonnade of slender Gothic pillars encloses
the monks’ garden, where two geese—sole occupants of
the <i>Paradiso</i>—chatter angrily at the intruder. No other
sound but the soft rustlings of palm branches and the
whispers of the wind in the orange-trees breaks the
silence of the long galleries and deserted cells.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the upper corridor with its broken pavement
chequered with dazzling patches of sunshine one looks out
from under the deep overshadowing eaves to where the
cathedral spires rise dim and distant across half the city.
The atmosphere of infinite peace that pervades these
cloisters—the sense of seclusion, although so near the
busy life outside the walls—must have appealed deeply
to the brown-frocked friars who once paced these
beautiful walks “revolving many memories.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bitter must have been the day of expulsion when this
monastery, like all the others in the island, was suppressed
in 1835.</p>

<p class='c013'>The church of San Nicolas contains a statue of Santa
Catalina, a Majorcan saint of great fame, and—incorporated
in the outer wall, is the rock on which she was sitting in
the bed of the Riéra at the moment when she was
informed of her admission into the convent of St. Magdalen.
The interiors of these southern churches are so
dark that it is with difficulty possible to make out the
statues that occupy the side chapels; here may be seen a
black Madonna and child of miraculous power; there a
group of saints laden with ex-votos in the shape of flat
silver images of men and women and models of human
limbs, hung upon their arms by grateful devotees; in
another niche is a life-sized Christ upon the cross—wearing
a fringed crimson petticoat to the knees and
a broad silver girdle with a bunch of artificial roses stuck
in it, while matted locks of real hair straggle out from
beneath the crown of thorns.</p>

with the blinding light outside that it is some considerable
time before one’s eyes become sufficiently accustomed to
the gloom to perceive the details of the rich interior.
The roof of the nave rises 150 feet above the level of the
pavement, and is divided from the side aisles by fourteen
great columns 70 feet in height, slender and stately as the
shafts of forest trees. High overhead—where the delicate
ribs of the vaulting cross—are carved the armorial shields
of knights, who for this privilege paid heavy sums in
bygone days towards the building of the church. Eight
chapels, gorgeous with statues and gilding, occupy either
side aisle, and above them are Gothic windows—so little
suited to this land of fierce light that they have had to be
bricked up, with the exception of a few tiny apertures
through which the sun shoots golden arrows. The faint
light that penetrates the rich rose windows above the
choir lies in jewelled stains upon the pavement, and does
little to dispel the solemn gloom.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the dim east end, far away, where wreaths of
incense rise and the high altar is outlined in brilliant
points of light, comes the distant chanting of priests
and the response of choir boys—and suddenly a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>rush of harmony fills the cathedral as the voice of the
organ sinks and swells like a storm-wind among the
columns, and dies trembling away in the uttermost
recesses of the great building.</p>

<p class='c013'>Worshippers move to and fro in constant succession;
men spread their handkerchiefs upon the stone floor and
remain upon their knees in prayer, wholly oblivious of
the coming and going around them. Women, dressed in
deepest black, kneel motionless at the <i>grilles</i> of the
various chapels, where lamps burn with a dull red spark
before the image of saint or Saviour. A stately <i>Suisse</i> in
wig and gown paces up and down and receives the visitor
desirous of seeing the treasures of the sacristy; here are
exhibited heavy silver candelabra, embroidered vestments,
jewelled crosses, and reliquaries—and in company
with these may be seen, bedizened with tawdry velvet
and sham ermine, the mummified body of Majorca’s
second king, Don Jaime II., who died in the year
1311.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in the old church of Santa Eulalia, not far
away, that in 1256 a general assembly was called to
proclaim this Don Jaime—the second son of the Conqueror—heir
to the crown of Majorca, his elder brother’s
inheritance being the throne of Aragon, which carried
with it a merely nominal suzerainty over the island
kingdom. Before long, however, a dispute arose over the
terms of allegiance due to the King of Aragon, and in
1285 Don Jaime was dispossessed of his kingdom by
Alfonso III. for thirteen years, after which time it was
restored to him by the usurper’s son, and retained till his
death.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>He was succeeded by his son Sancho, who died without
children, and the crown then passed to his uncle, the
fourth son of the Conqueror, and through him to Don
Jaime III., the last King of Majorca, who fell upon the
field of Lluchmayor in 1349, in a last attempt to regain
the crown wrested from him by Pedro IV. of Aragon.</p>

<p class='c013'>So ended—within little more than a hundred years of
its creation—the independent monarchy founded by Jaime
the Conqueror, and the islands have from that time been
incorporated with the kingdom of Aragon.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the fine sixteenth-century town hall is preserved a
full-length portrait of the Conqueror, which represents
him as a grave-faced man with a pointed beard and hair
cut square upon the shoulders, robed in crimson mantle,
ermine collar, crown, and sword. For many centuries it
was the custom to celebrate the anniversary of the
capture of Palma by exhibiting this portrait outside
the town hall, surmounted by the royal standard of
Aragon and surrounded by the portraits of eminent
Majorcans.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The town contains innumerable other features of
interest, but before leaving this portion of my subject I
must not omit a mention of the <i>Lónja</i>—the Exchange—a
large building standing near the harbour, and one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>first objects to attract the attention of the traveller as he
nears the quay. Its keep-like walls and turreted parapets
are usually the subject of much admiration, but I must
confess that to us the great building seemed too symmetrically
square and too conspicuously new to awaken
in us any enthusiasm for its exterior.</p>

<p class='c013'>Severely rectangular it undoubtedly is—but its appearance
of newness is misleading, for it dates from the
fifteenth century, when it was the custom for Spanish
towns to vie with one another in the splendour of their
Exchanges; its claim, therefore, to be one of the finest
<i>Lónjas</i> in Spain is a legitimate source of pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is said to have been begun in 1409, when the
merchants of Palma, having rendered the King of Aragon
great aid in the conquest of Sardinia, received permission
to levy a tax on all the outgoing and incoming wares of
foreigners and pirate persons; and so large was the sum
accruing from this protective toll that after applying part
of it to the defence of their commerce at sea they devoted
the remainder to building this splendid Exchange—a
testimony to future generations of the extent and prosperity
of Palma’s trade in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>The interior is extremely striking, containing nine
fluted and twisted columns of great height, their delicate
groinings spreading in palm-like tracery over the roof.
The building has long been disused, and the light that
enters as the shutters are flung wide of the great windows
looking out to sea discloses nothing but some old
paintings upon the walls and a jumble of sculptured
fragments piled upon the stone seats that surround
the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>It will perhaps be thought strange that a town so
comparatively easy of access as Palma, and possessing
so much to attract the artist and the antiquarian, should
be so little known to the world at large. Yet if we reflect
how small a distance from the beaten track will suffice to
deflect ninety-nine per cent of the travelling public, it is no
subject for wonder that Majorca is still an unknown isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain number of travellers pass through Palma on
their way to and from Algiers, but the island in general
is as yet barely aware of the existence of the tourist, and
he is quite a recent institution even in Palma itself, where
the opening of the Grand Hotel three years ago may be
said to have inaugurated a new era.</p>

<p class='c013'>Viewed in the light of a tourist resort the old town is
so far behind the times that she brings me in mind of
some old-fashioned châtelaine who with dignity offers her
guests of her best, without in any way altering her mode
of life to suit the standard of modern requirements. I
can recall but two shopkeepers in Palma who knew any
language but Spanish, and at the Bank a special clerk is
hastily summoned if an Englishman chances to enter the
door. An English church—the earliest sign of a recurring
visitors’ season—is as yet only represented by a
mission-room in the suburb of Santa Catalina, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Church of England service is read every Sunday by a
Wesleyan minister.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the globe-trotter it will come as a surprise to find
that he is no longer under the world-wide ægis of Thomas
Cook, and that that name by which he has hitherto conjured
conveys nothing whatever to a Majorcan official.
The foreigner who visits the remoter villages of the
interior is still looked upon as something of a curiosity;
he will have to drive in native carriages, live on native
food, and bid a temporary farewell to that cosmopolitan
standard of comfort provided for all who travel the world’s
highways. But he will at least be sure of one thing—an
unfailing welcome by an island race noted for its charming
manners.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think the courtesy of the natives is one of the first
things to strike the new-comer in Palma. Many a time
as we rambled about the labyrinthine streets of the town
did a Spanish lady come out of her way to ask if she could
be of any use in directing us; in any difficulty you may
apply without hesitation to one of the common soldiers
with which the town swarms, and with all the instinct of
a well-bred man he will immediately do his utmost to be
of assistance, nor would his own colonel more deeply resent
the inference of inferiority conveyed by the offer of a tip.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bow with which a native gentleman asks you to
enter his <i>patio</i> and photograph what you will is only
equalled by that of the peasant who rises from table at a
wayside cottage to ask the passing stranger to be seated
and to share his meal.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In a country where manners cease to form a distinction
between the classes social intercourse becomes easy and
natural. A market-woman will enter the democratic
tram, dragging with her an unmanageable and overflowing
basket, and the gentleman seated next her will without
hesitation accept half of it on his knees, hand it after her
when she rises, and raise his hat as she turns to thank
him. There is neither thought of condescension on his
part nor of presumption on hers.</p>

<p class='c013'>School attendance is not compulsory in Majorca, and
many of the peasants with whom we came in contact
were wholly illiterate; yet in no instance had the proverbial
twopence extra for manners been spared in their
education. I remember how when talking to a muleteer we
once regretted our inability to speak Spanish more fluently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, but the Señora speaks well!” he said quickly;
“think how difficult I should find it if it was I who had
to learn <em>her</em> language!” And an old man chimed in,
“And I, Señora, cannot even write!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>patois</i> spoken by the peasants is a dialect composed
of the old Catalonian tongue alloyed with a strong
dash of Provençal French, and it bears very little resemblance
to the Spanish of Castile, which became the
language of the educated classes after the union of
Ferdinand and Isabella. The latter is, however, the
tongue taught in the schools, and the stranger who can
speak “castelláno” will find himself understood throughout
the Balearic Islands, barring by a few of the older
and more illiterate peasants.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The people of Palma are so little accustomed to
Spanish-speaking foreigners that some of the shopkeepers
cannot be brought to mention the price of an article to
their customers, but persist in counting out the required
sum into their own hand and exhibiting it in dumb show—to
the exasperation of a certain German lady who
objected to being “treated like a child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The shopping expeditions of more or less speechless
tourists must necessarily be productive of many a laughable
incident, yet I never saw a native betray the slightest
amusement at the mistakes committed; I have indeed
had my hand wrung with heartfelt sympathy by a good
woman to whom I was struggling to explain myself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chief shopping centre for visitors is perhaps the
<i>Platería</i>—a narrow street occupied by working silver-smiths—where
gold and silver chains are measured off
and sold by the palm, and bits of old enamel and peasant
jewellery, in the shape of antique pendants and crosses,
are displayed in the little windows. Amongst the most
fascinating objects are clusters of silver-gilt buttons set
with amethyst and garnet, such as are worn by the
countrywomen on <i>fête</i> days, and dozens of minute silver
charms representing baskets, lanterns, tubs, and other
familiar objects, reduced to the scale of a mouse’s belongings;
while hanging everywhere, of all sizes and
shapes, are the silver chain purses used by every
Majorcan, and exported by the thousand—to be sold at
double the price by fashionable jewellers in London.</p>

<p class='c013'>Few foreigners leave Palma without a souvenir in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>form of a piece of old-fashioned faïence or majolica—the
latter an imitation of the Arab lustre ware—manufactured
at the neighbouring <i>fabrique</i>, along with the pretty glazed
tiles, originally introduced from Valencia, with which the
Majorcans face the steps of their staircases. Other local
industries include lace-making and embroidery, basket-weaving,
the plaiting of complicated string seats and
backs to the native chairs, tanning and shoemaking—in
which latter branch a large export trade is carried on
with South America. Shoes are cheap, and it is quite
noticeable how neatly shod the Majorcans of all classes
are.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Majorcans are good workers, and their charges
moderate. The scale of wages is low, but so is the cost
of living, and it would be difficult to find a more contented
and prosperous-looking race than these islanders.</p>

<p class='c013'>Extreme cleanliness is one of their most salient characteristics;
they are noted too for their good looks, and
it is indeed rare to find a plain face among them; and
this, combined with a sensible, cheerful expression and
a natural talent for effective colouring in dress, renders
them a remarkably picturesque and attractive people. The
country girls still retain the muslin coif, or <i>rebosillo</i>, which
once formed the universal female headgear, but in Palma
this has given way to a handkerchief worn somewhat far
back on the head over beautifully dressed hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarlet skirts are much in vogue among the working
classes, but, on the whole, soft half-tones are preferred
to the primary colours, and a crowd of market-women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>presents a gay kaleidoscopic scene in which lemon-yellows,
sage-greens, salmon-pinks, brown-reds, and turquoise
blues are worn side by side with charming and harmonious
effect.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>In the early morning the big market-place in the upper
town is the <i>rendezvous</i> of countless housewives, bargaining
busily, basket on arm, for the day’s provisions.
Under the long arcades bordering the cobbled square are
installed the sellers of fruit and vegetables, with plaited
ropes of garlic, pans of fresh olives, strings of scarlet
capsicums and bitter tomatoes, hampers of newly picked
oranges, bunches of pale Majorcan dates and still paler
bananas, and masses of figs turned out <i>en bloc</i> from big
rush baskets lined with leaves. A neighbouring booth
supplies flat fig cakes stuffed with almonds and aniseed,
and slices of dark red <i>Carne de Membrillo</i>—an excellent
quince preserve, in consistency like damson cheese.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fish market, where the morning’s catch is
displayed upon marble slabs, rises a very babel of voices.
Loud and shrill is the clamour of the fishwives as they
detain the passer-by with a scaly hand, and seek to
repair the mischief with a no less scaly apron. Crabs and
lobsters lie sprawling upon their backs, and wave stemmy
legs amongst marine creatures never seen upon a hotel
table—giant shell-fish, octopuses lying in knotted heaps,
jelly-like squids, ugly thorny monsters who are all head,
and gorgeous little fishes coloured like macaws—scarlet,
blue, yellow, or glittering with metallic greens and
reds.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>By midday all will have been sold, and the market
square given up to tall, cadaverous-looking dogs that
saunter round the deserted stalls and pick up what
fragments remain. Gaunt, listless, and apparently
starving, these dogs of Palma attract the attention of
every new-comer; and thanks to a fellow-guest at the
Grand Hotel, our own interest in them was specially
aroused. This Swiss scientist had come to Majorca to
study the domestic animals of the island, and the result
of his researches had proved a theory he had long held—that
somewhere on the shores of the Mediterranean
would be found descendants of the dogs of ancient
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c013'>This island breed, known locally as Iviza dogs—but
dubbed by the unappreciative foreigner “degenerate
greyhounds” and “pariahs”—can boast a longer pedigree
than any dogs under the sun, for they are descended
from the much-prized hunting dogs of the old Egyptians.
Introduced ages ago by Greek or Phœnician colonists,
they are now peculiar to the Balearics, where they are
found in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c013'>They are the size of a large greyhound, with smooth
coats usually yellow and white. Nothing will fatten
them: the pampered favourite of a great house is as lean
as his scavenging <i>confrère</i> of the market-place, and, like
him, he wears a look of melancholy weariness not unfitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>an old, old race that has existed since the dawn
of history. The chief characteristic of the breed is their
long, pointed ears, which when pricked stand stiffly erect,
and never droop as do those of the somewhat similar
hounds imported from Algeria and Morocco. These ears,
with the long, narrow muzzle, give the dogs a striking
resemblance to the jackal-headed god Anubis of Egyptian
sculpture.</p>

<p class='c013'>They are mild, timid creatures, quite useless as watchdogs,
but popular as pets, and—like their original
ancestors—much valued for purposes of the chase.
Landowners keep them for coursing hares and rabbits,
of which they catch extraordinary quantities; and so
devoted are the dogs to this sport that those belonging
to peasants on large estates have frequently to be
hobbled, and are seen wearing steel bracelets on their
fore and hind leg, connected with a light chain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another interesting relic of a bygone race is seen in
the survival in the Balearics—so our Swiss professor
pointed out—of the Greek type of horse familiar to
travellers who have seen the statues of Balbus—<i>père et
fils</i>—in the Naples Museum. These animals are not
very common, but here and there one comes across a
horse differing utterly from the prevailing Andalusian
type. Round and compact, often black in colour, and
with stiff mane and tail, these horses have a remarkably
arched crest and a slightly convex outline of nose—the
profile of head and neck being represented rather by the
segment of a circle than by the right angle formed at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>apex of the skull by the lines of the slender Spanish
horse.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Mules are largely used in the Balearics, Majorca being
especially celebrated for its breed. They are big, handsome
animals, unusually docile, owing to the gentle
treatment they receive, and a good pair of carriage mules
is more sought after and more valuable than is a pair of
the best Continental horses. Nearly all the carriages of
the Palma gentry are drawn by fast-trotting mules, and
towards evening a perfect procession of <i>galarétas</i> wends
its way westward along the sea road, each with its match
pair of strong, sure-footed beasts that make nothing of
the hills to be encountered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half an hour’s drive along this road brings one to the
wooded knoll beyond Santa Catalina, on which stands
the old castle of Bellver, a well-preserved thirteenth-century
fortress, whose yellow walls rise above the
surrounding pines, foursquare and stately. In olden
days it was used as a residence by the Kings of Majorca—in
later times it served as a state prison—and now it
stands empty, the last use it was put to having been as
an astronomical station for the English expedition which
went out to Palma in 1905 to observe the solar eclipse.
From the grounds round the castle a most lovely view of
the town is obtained through the pine-trees, and it is
amongst these woods that a new hotel is now being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>built, to be opened this year under the name of
Hotel Victoria. It will be under the same management
as the Grand Hotel in Palma, and being connected with
the town by a service of trams it will no doubt prove
extremely popular with visitors who prefer life amid
country surroundings.</p>

<p class='c013'>A mile or so beyond Bellver we come to the little
harbour of Porto Pi, the mouth of the creek guarded by
an old Moorish signal tower, now converted into a lighthouse,
though still used for signalling purposes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not till we get beyond Porto Pi that we reach
the real country and find ourselves amongst olives and
asphodel; and here the Spanish ladies descend from
their carriages and stroll bareheaded along the road—the
only form of exercise in which they indulge. The
Majorcan roads are upon the whole very good, though
dusty in dry weather; and they are kept in far better
repair than one would be led to expect from watching the
leisurely procedure of the <i>Péon caminéro</i>, who brings
stones and earth upon the scene in small basketfuls,
moistens them with a watering-pot, and stamps them in
patiently with a small rammer. When, however, he has
occasion to spread road metal in greater quantities he
takes a high hand with the public, and procuring large
boulders he arranges them on alternate sides of the road,
so as to compel passing vehicles to drive over the fresh
stone; he is considerate enough to remove these
stumbling-blocks at nightfall, but it is a ludicrous sight
to see a whole string of smart carriages twisting in and
out of these obstacles as if in a driving competition, in
obedience to the arbitrary behest of the road-maker.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The almost universal type of native carriage is the
<i>galaréta</i>, a light-running covered vehicle, in appearance
not unlike a baker’s cart on four wheels. The hinder
part is entered from the rear, and is seated like a wagonette;
there is a window on either side, and another
dividing it from the broad hooded seat in front on which
the driver sits.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the foreigner these covered carriages appear intensely
uncomfortable; if he be above the medium height
his head comes in irritating contact with the roof; he can
see hardly anything of the landscape from the windows,
and he never ceases to marvel at the natives who can
pack themselves in incredible numbers into one of these
little-eases and emerge unruffled and cheerful at the end
of a long drive. Yet it must be admitted that in its own
country the <i>galaréta</i> possesses several distinct advantages
over the open carriage; its occupants are indifferent to sun
and rain, and can protect themselves from both dust and
wind; on the hottest summer’s day a draught can be
created by lowering the glasses and drawing the Venetian
shutters with which each window is fitted, while upon
the homeward drive the chilly night air can be as easily
excluded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like all Southerners the Majorcans dread the change of
temperature that takes place at sundown, and towards
evening they wrap themselves in cloaks and mufflers,
while the fearless foreigner sits out on a terrace to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>enjoy the sunset and is extremely indignant at waking
next morning with a sore throat.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a land where the new-born year is so amazingly
precocious it is difficult to remember that in England he
is still in his white swaddling clothes; by the end of
January the plain around Palma is decked with miles of
almond orchards in full bloom, their faint scent filling
the air and their laden branches covering the country
with billowy white masses. The wind has forestalled
the date of the Carnival, and his last night’s Battle of
Flowers has flung deep drifts of snowy confetti upon the
sprouting wheat beneath the trees. But there are still
snow-caps on the blue hills away to the north, and a
sudden rattling storm of hail reminds us that even in
Majorca Spring is not yet fully enthroned.</p>

<p class='c013'>By February a vast expanse of young wheat has
clothed the land in a garment of the crudest Pre-Raphaelite
green—almost startling in its intensity when
seen in contrast with sea or sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the first week in March new potatoes and green
peas are in the market, the orchards are knee-deep in
beans, and the whole island is fragrant with bean blossom.
In the carob groves—where the knotted trunks and
twisted limbs of the old trees cast strange shadows
on the swaying corn—are purple anemones, pink
gladiolus, and a blue shimmer of honey-scented grape-hyacinths.</p>

<p class='c013'>The long days of unbroken sunshine are now devoted
to excursions into the surrounding country, and visitors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>begin to leave the town in which they have wintered and
to roam further afield.</p>

<p class='c013'>A favourite drive is to the neighbouring Château of
Raxa, a country seat belonging to the Count of Montenegro,
where the grounds are laid out in Italian fashion with
orange and cypress terraces, stone vases and statues, and
splendid flights of marble steps. Roses, violets, freesias,
and heliotrope were in full bloom in the gardens on
March 3rd, and the women engaged on the orange
harvest handed down to us branches heavy with fragrant
golden fruit. Oranges are nothing accounted of in
Majorca, and lemons are looked upon as so far below
all price that they are given one for the asking, any idea
of payment being vigorously scouted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road to Raxa runs for many miles through a red
plain given up to olive culture; whether it is the soil
of Majorca that is responsible for the extraordinary
grotesqueness of the olive-trees I cannot say, but they
resemble nothing I have ever seen in other lands.
Stretching away in quaint perspective on either hand
are distorted grey forms suggestive of an enchanted
forest; many of the old trees stand on a kind of tripod
formed by the splitting and shrinking of their own trunk;
here a hoary veteran of many centuries has wound himself
into an excellent imitation of a corkscrew; a group
of twisted crones appears to gossip together with uplifted
hands, while two sprawling wrestlers are locked as in a
death-struggle in each other’s arms. Here squats a
gnarled mass like nothing so much as a gigantic toad;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>there a boa-constrictor twines itself in folds about its
prey, and an antediluvian monster stoops to examine with
interest the strange human insect that has adventured
itself within reach.</p>

<p class='c013'>So endless are the variations of form assumed by these
extraordinary trees, so fascinating is each fresh discovery,
that one wanders on and on, like children in a bewitched
wood, and a determined effort of will is required to tear
oneself away from such a scene and return to the carriage
awaiting one on the prosaic high-road.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The same weird olive groves will be found on the way
to Alaró, a small inland town lying at the foot of the
mountains, near which are the ruins of the castle—famous
in Majorcan history—which one morning in
March we set out by rail to visit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Majorcan trains are not fashionable in their hours,
and it was little after daybreak that we steamed out of
the Palma station and glided away through richly
cultivated fields of beans and wheat, where pleasant
homesteads stood embowered in almond orchards and
fat yellow lemons bobbed over the garden walls. As the
line approaches the mountains the country becomes
wilder and more open; vast undulating expanses of
stony red ground are being slowly ploughed by mule
teams, and miles upon miles of fig-trees cast a white
shimmer over the plain—their leafless branches so pale
as in the distance to resemble blossoming orchards. The
dark glistening green of carob groves contrasts vividly
with the feathery grey of the olive, and as a background
to the scene a dark belt of pine-trees crowns the red slope
and stands out in brilliant relief against the indigo blue
ranges of the Sierra.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Within an hour we descend at Consell and change to
the branch line forming the connection with Alaró; a
small tram was awaiting us outside the station, and this
proved to be the branch line. No road was in sight, but
the tram lines vanished into an endless perspective of
beanfields, and through these we were slowly drawn
by two horses harnessed tandem fashion. Our only
fellow-travellers in the tiny front compartment—reserved
for the rich who could afford to pay threepence—were a
couple of buxom market-women, most deeply interested
in our appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quaint things happen so easily in Majorca that we
were not much surprised on reaching Alaró when the
tram conductor got down, shouldered our camera and the
heavy luncheon basket, and without a word marched
away towards the village inn as though it were his
business in life to conduct strange ladies there. Setting
rocking chairs for us among the wine barrels, he lit a
cigar and proceeded to assist in the saddling of the two
donkeys that had been ordered overnight for our ascent
to the castle of Alaró. One was a riding donkey for my
companion, the other a pack animal to carry our impedimenta,
its pack saddle being furnished with panniers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>fitted with the native breeching strap—a wooden contrivance
shaped like a Cupid’s bow, which fits across the
donkey’s hind legs and rubs off all the hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Away we started in brilliant sunshine with an old man
and a boy in attendance, and turning into a narrow track
between stone walls we followed a babbling torrent through
carob and orange gardens and began to wind up the hillside
by a steep zigzag path. Innumerable sheep-bells
tinkled among the olive yards, and the voice of a herdsman
rang out in a Gregorian chant from far up the
heights where he tended his goats among holm oak and
pine. Sheer above us towered the perpendicular red
scarp of the cliff on which the castle stands, a small
white speck upon its edge the <i>Hospedéria</i> of the summit.</p>

<p class='c013'>A couple of hours’ stiff climb brings one to the back of
the cliff, and scaling a rough rock staircase one enters
the precincts of the old fortress through a Moorish gate
tower with a curious double archway—the outer arch
being round-headed and the inner one pointed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a great wedge of cheese with straight cut sides
does the cliff of Alaró stand out into the plain; its perpendicular
front rises sheer in a terrific precipice, its only
approach a steep ascent commanded by a fortified tower.
Small need to be told that by assault the castle was
impregnable; but it was subdued by siege and starvation
in 1285, when Alfonso the Beneficent of Aragon warred
with Jaime II. of Majorca. What followed the surrender
of Alaró is known to every Majorcan; the Conqueror,
exasperated by the vain but most gallant defence of the
castle, had its two governors burnt alive at the stake in
the presence of his whole army.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>So perished the heroes Cabrit and Bassa, leaving their
names to be handed down through the centuries as the
names of men who died loyal to their king at a time when
the greater part of the island had gone over to the usurper.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Majorca again came into the hands of the legitimate
line the ashes of the canonised heroes were placed
in an urn and deposited beneath an altar in Palma
Cathedral, where they remain to this day; and every
succeeding generation hears from childhood up the stirring
tale of how the two patriots fought and how they died.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little oratory of Our Lady of Refuge stands upon
the summit of the cliff, and no doubt originated as the
chapel of the fortress. Subsequently it became a
renowned sanctuary, and attached to it, as is usual in
Majorca, is a small <i>hospéderia</i>, or hostelry, where pilgrims
and visitors can obtain a night’s shelter. The view from
this point is worth coming far to see; unrolled like a map
at one’s feet, far, far below, is the great southern plain,
from the Bay of Palma on the west, where the dark mass
of the cathedral still shows just visible above the faint
haze enveloping the city, to the glittering Bay of Alcúdia
upon the far east coast. All the cities of the plain—Inca,
Benisalém, La Puebla, Múro, and Lluchmayór, lie outspread
before us. Behind us, range upon range, are the
wooded slopes of the Sierra, the topmost peaks still
crowned with snow; threads of quicksilver flash down
the mountainsides, and valley, plain, and hill alike are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>enveloped in a grey sea of olive-trees, dwarfed by distance
to the semblance of lavender bushes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some idea of the height of the rock on which we stand
is obtained by dropping a stone over the edge; peering
over the abyss as we lay full length on the ground we
launched a small boulder into space, and, watch in hand,
timed its descent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One, two, three,” the seconds ticked away, and still
the stone fell, though to our eyes it appeared already to
have reached the olive groves; “four, five, six,” and not
till now did a dull crash come up from below to tell us
that the stone was at its journey’s end. We arose
cautiously and walked back along the very centre of the
cliff, feeling in every nerve that were we to stumble
nothing could save us from covering fully thirty feet in
our fall and disappearing over the edge of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rejoining our donkeys, we set off on our downward
ride. Midway we were overtaken by a party of boisterous
young men who tore down the mountainside laughing
and shouting, gave us a breathless good-day in passing,
and vanished with giant strides down a precipitous shortcut,
apparently intent on breaking their necks. We
looked on aghast, but our guides evidently considered
it no abnormal way of descending a mountain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going downhill no one is old,” says the island proverb
reassuringly; no doubt the subsequent stiffness of our
own knees was the result of not having gone down
sufficiently fast.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The Palma carnival differs so greatly from that function
as celebrated on the Riviera as to be worthy of mention.
There the tourist element and its accompanying ostentation
of wealth are the most conspicuous features of the
performance. Here, in Palma, all this is wholly lacking,
and the carnival has retained its native character to a
truly refreshing degree. It is essentially a people’s
festival, with hardly a foreigner present.</p>

<p class='c013'>From three o’clock in the afternoon till late at night
the whole town is <i>en fête</i>; all the shops are shut, and the
shop people sit in merry groups before their doors; the
balconies overlooking the Borne are crowded, and the wide
Borne itself is a seething throng of people on foot sauntering
up and down, and chaffing one another in high good-humour.</p>

<p class='c013'>The troops—of which five or six thousand are quartered
at Palma—send a large contingent to the crowd of
holiday-makers; infantrymen in long, blue coats,
crimson trousers, and bright green gloves, mingle with
pretty girls in kerchief and <i>rebosillo</i>, whose hair is
powdered thick with coloured confetti. Here is an old
peasant, come in from the country, wearing under his hat
a handkerchief wound round his head in the style of his
Catalonian ancestors; his wife has donned her gayest
shawl, and has brought the baby, who chuckles with
delight at the festive scene and wears a funny little
straw hat shaped like a Saracen turban trimmed with
scarlet pompoms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tiny maidens of four and five are costumed as grand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>ladies, and walk about, quaintly dignified, with proudly
trailing train and flaunting fan, in rich brocade skirts and
velvet bodices, with long, white gloves, and hair elaborately
dressed with flowers and high tortoise-shell combs.
A party of Arabs, draped in white sheets and armed with
spears, lead about an unfortunate comrade disguised as
a dancing bear, who is vigorously kept up to his part
throughout the day; and small boys, dressed as Pierrots,
or rejoicing simply in the disguise afforded by a pasteboard
nose and a high falsetto voice, caper unrestrained through
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towards evening a couple of hundred carriages turn
out into the streets; galarétas, landaus, dogcarts, and
wagons form into line and follow each other in slow
procession round and round the Borne. The smart
barouche and pair of the Captain-General is preceded by
a humble donkey-cart, and followed by a heavy country
<i>charrette</i> overflowing with clowns. Every one is dressed
according to taste, and every one is free to throw things
at every one else. The imperturbably correct coachman
of a stylish turn-out gets hit on the nose by an egg-shell
stuffed with confetti; the gentleman seated beside him—who
wears a mask and an amazing tow-wig—replies with
a well-directed volley, and a furious fusillade ensues, the
enemy coming up to the very windows of the galarétas to
pour in a deadly fire among the occupants.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mounted officers, armed with paper rockets, do battle
with the people in the balconies, who, in return, hail
down missiles and torrents of confetti upon their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>assailants. Eggshells fly in showers from carriage to
carriage, smashing upon any head they meet with. On
the wide Place Weyler the confetti lie so thick that the
square resembles some cathedral floor—tinted by stained
glass windows, and the carriages and horses are so tangled
up in coloured streamers that they appear to have broken
through a great rainbow spider’s web and carried it bodily
away with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>By eight o’clock the Carnival is a thing of the past, and
the gay, good-humoured crowd is in full retreat, thoroughly
tired out.</p>

<p class='c013'>And at midnight the stars look down upon a sleeping
city, whose stillness is only broken by the sonorous chant
of the watchmen going their rounds with lantern and staff.
The familiar cry—so associated with Palma—again rings
out beneath our windows:—</p>

  <h2 id='ch2' class='c004'>PART II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Although it falls to the lot of few of us to
remain as sublimely unconscious of geography as
was Charles Lamb—who asserts that though he held a
correspondence with a very dear friend in New South
Wales he was unable to form the remotest conjecture as
to the position of that <i>Terra Incognita</i>—yet I think I may
safely assume that not many of my readers are familiar
with the geography of Majorca, and a glance at the
<a href='#map'>sketch-map</a> given in this volume may be of service in
acquainting them with the principal places of interest in
the island.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact which perhaps chiefly strikes one is the
miniature scale of distances. Just as the mouse occupies
the same space on the page of a book on natural history
as does the elephant, so does Majorca appear in its own
particular map to be as large as Ceylon; and it gives one
repeated shocks of surprise to find that what looks like
a day’s journey is a matter of two hours by rail, or a
morning’s carriage drive. There are half a dozen excursions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>which visitors to the island rarely fail to make; one
is to Sollér, only a day’s expedition by carriage from Palma—though,
as it possesses a comfortable little hotel and is
in the midst of beautiful scenery, it is a favourite place
for a lengthened stay. The old towns of Pollensa and
Alcúdia upon the east coast attract a certain number of
foreigners every season; and the fame of Arta’s stalactite
caves draws thither a large number of sightseers, being
easy of reach from the railhead at Manacór.</p>

<p class='c013'>But with these exceptions the interior of Majorca
enjoys an almost perpetual immunity from tourists, most
of whom are far from enterprising.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was to Arta that we ourselves were bound when we
quitted Palma on March 12th, but having plenty of time
before us, and being fond of driving tours, open air, and
scenery, we decided to do the whole journey by road, and
to spend as many nights <i>en route</i> as we found desirable.
Our carriage was one of the hotel victorias, drawn by an
excellent pair of little grey horses; our luggage was of
the most modest description, consisting of two of those
feather-weight valises, made of brown cardboard, that
can be bought for a few shillings in most Continental
towns, and that belie their frail appearance by resisting
ill-usage to an almost incredible degree. Our driver was
a friendly and reliable native, who in all the years he had
driven hotel carriages had never been asked to conduct
anybody across the island. It was indeed an unheard-of
thing to do. Was not the railway there to take people
to Arta? and was it not well known that the southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>districts of the island contained nothing that could be of
any possible interest to any one? However, it was no
affair of his if English ladies were eccentric; his not to
question why. Their motives might be inscrutable, but
he was there to carry out their wishes, whether wise or
foolish.</p>

<p class='c013'>No June morning could have been more glorious than
the one on which we left the Grand Hotel, and, rattling
over the cobbles down to the harbour, struck out southwards
towards Lluchmayór. For a couple of hours we
crossed a great plain, carefully tilled and tended. In the
orange gardens the golden crop was being gathered by
peasants mounted on easel-shaped ladders. Stretches of
corn and beans alternated with extensive fig orchards,
which in July supply a harvest so bounteous that even
the pigs fare sumptuously upon the fruit. Thick as
faggots of dead wood were the leafless branches of the old
trees—their elbows stuck out at an aggressive angle as
though resenting the proximity of their somewhat
heathenish-looking neighbour, the prickly pear, which
in Majorca is termed the “Moorish fig,” as opposed to
the “Christian fig” of cultivation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Standing up above the level of the orchards, and
extending over the plain in numbers that suggest an
immense pyrotechnic display in preparation, are countless
wind wheels, twenty or thirty feet in diameter, furnished
with a tail to keep their heads to the wind, and with sets
of wooden slats that furl and unfurl like a fan, according
to the strength of the breeze. Raised upon stone platforms
and spinning round rapidly, these wheels are
engaged in raising water from wells and pumping it into
the great reservoirs that in summer supply the irrigation
aqueducts intersecting the fields.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>At noon we reached Lluchmayór, and after lunching at
the inn we visited the great high-backed church that
prides itself on being the largest in the island outside
Palma. It was deserted save for the presence of three
old charwomen, who alternately chatted and laughed or
piously mumbled <i>Ave Marias</i> and <i>Pater nosters</i> as they
plied their flappers about the pulpit and the quaint old
pews, resembling settees, with curved backs and deep
seats inlaid with scenes in coloured woods. A wax figure
of Santa Candida in a glass case, and some marvellous
embroideries with inch-deep scrolls of gold thread set
with precious stones, are amongst the most treasured
possessions of this church.</p>

<p class='c013'>On again, through Campos, whence we look back to
catch a last glimpse of the Palma Cathedral—far away
across the plain; and the evening shadows are lengthening
fast as we drive into Santagný, where we are to spend
the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Santagný is the southernmost town in Majorca, and as
such suffered sorely in bygone time from the Algerian
and Moroccan pirates who infested the neighbouring islet
of Cabréra. In the sixteenth century the town was
encircled with walls, to prevent the repetition of a raid
that devastated the whole countryside and forced the
inhabitants to fly for safety to the interior of the island.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>But centuries of safety have razed the fortifications more
surely than any piratical attack, and one massive gateway—standing
in the market-place—alone remains to
testify to the dangers run by the townspeople in olden
days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>fonda</i>, or inn, at Santagný proved to be one of
those truly primitive establishments that cause one to
ponder the eternal question as to which comes first—the
tourist or the inn. The problem regarding the hen and
the egg is itself not more elusive than the vicious circle
in which one becomes involved when dwelling on this
subject. It is highly improbable that the accommodation
at Santagný will undergo any improvement until visitors
have shown some sign of wishing to come to the town;
it is equally improbable that visitors will show any signs
of wishing to come to Santagný until the accommodation
has been improved.</p>

<p class='c013'>I must admit that the supper passed off in comparative
style. We sat in a small, whitewashed room downstairs—our
driver and a soldier also supping there at another
table—and in place of the bell of conventionality we
clapped our hands between the courses, which consisted
of an excellent omelette, a dish of meat and rice, and
oranges sliced with sugar. Our hostess’s attentions were
somewhat spasmodic owing to the periodical raids she
made on certain small boys whose noses were flattened
on the window-pane, and at whom she dashed out very
suddenly—belabouring such as came under her hand with
a large market basket. In the outer room a guitar was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>being strummed, and the voices of the men sitting drinking
there broke out now and then in a resonant chorus. All
this was very nice and native; but when we went upstairs
to our bedrooms it was still very native—only not so nice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three small and stuffy cubicles opened off the landing
at the head of the stairs; the only one that obtained any
light or air was the end one, which had a small window
in the outer wall of the house, but—as if to compensate
for this advantage—it lacked a door, the privacy of its
occupant being dependant upon a flimsy curtain that
fluttered airily to and fro in the doorway. Each cubicle
contained a bed, a chair, and a straw mat on the floor;
and outside, on the landing, stood one small washstand,
with a set of toilet appliances destined to be shared by all
the occupants of the bedrooms. That the centre room
was already engaged was evident from an unmistakably
masculine snore that proceeded from it. Horses munched
loudly in a stall below, and the petulant voices of dreaming
pigs rose to the skies from an adjoining farmyard.
Even our driver—who never considered his duties at an
end until he had personally inspected our sleeping quarters
for the night—expressed disapproval at the prospect,
although his sympathetic shrugs plainly intimated that
as we had made our beds so must we lie upon them.
I speak figuratively, for as a matter of fact our beds were
not made at all, though we had been more than two hours
in the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Amidst such unpromising surroundings did we eventually
retire for the night, waking to find that our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>neighbour of the middle room had most opportunely
taken himself off in the small hours of the morning,
leaving us in sole possession of the washstand, so that
our toilet was accomplished in comparative safety, and
with no other interruption than the sudden appearance
of our hostess on her way upstairs to fetch a sausage from
the attic. It is but fair to say that this was the only
<i>fonda</i> we met with in the whole of our wanderings that
was so primitive in its arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>On going down to breakfast our hostess presents us
each with a thick tumbler containing a species of strong,
brown broth, very nourishing, I should suppose, for an
invalid; swelling with pride, she reveals the fact that the
strange beverage we are drinking is <i>tea</i>—and it is doubtless
on the strength of this compliment to our nationality
that she presently tenders us a bill for fourteen pesetas—ten
shillings and sixpence—a sum not overwhelming in
itself, but absurdly high according to the standard of
charges current in Majorcan inns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five pesetas—four shillings—a day for each person is
the recognised charge for board and lodging at all the
best <i>fondas</i> in Majorca. At a little hotel, such as that
of Sollér or Alcúdia, one’s <i>pension</i> may run as high as six
or even seven and a half pesetas; but these are the
outside prices; and one’s driver’s food—for which one
is expected to pay while on tour—should never exceed
two pesetas a day.</p>

<p class='c013'>At small native inns an arrangement as to terms should
always be made on arrival. Particularly is this the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in out-of-the-way villages where strangers are rarely seen,
and where the innkeeper will occasionally endeavour to
make a profit out of all proportion to the accommodation
provided for his guests. This sharp dealing is so little in
keeping with the character of the average Majorcan that
I can only explain it by quoting the people’s own saying,
to the effect that there is not room for honour and profit
in the same pocket. I think that the opportunity offered
of enriching themselves easily at the expense of well-to-do
foreigners proves too great a temptation for certain
<i>fondistas</i> who have lost the finer feelings possessed by
their compatriots not engaged in trade.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quitting Santagný we drove on to Felanitx, a pretty
little town surrounded by low hills whose crests are
occupied by many windmills frantically waving their arms
on the sky line. Windmills are everywhere. Some stand
singly upon barrow-like mounds crowned with cactus
tangles, others are massed upon ridges in the gregarious
manner characteristic of Majorcan corn mills. All have
either six or eight sails, which gives them a very full-bodied
appearance; and some are furnished with tail
feathers, and resemble large dragon-flies that have interrupted
their whirring flight to settle for an instant with
outspread gauzy wings upon a little tower of dazzling
whiteness. An old miller leans out of a little upper
window in one of the mills, filling it up so completely
that we wonder if he will ever get back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Buena vista!</i>” we call up to him as he watches us
from his lofty perch.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Ah, yes!” he replies, looking far out over the sunny
landscape, “from here one sees all the world!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is in truth a very lovely world upon which he looks
down this bright March morning. The almond orchards
are streaming down the hill slopes and invading the town
in torrents of young spring verdure; the houses are screwing
up their eyes in the sunshine, even the tiniest windows
being half built up with slabs of freestone, while many
are closed entirely. Old women sit at their doorways
plaiting and spinning, and greet us cheerfully as we pass,
and leaving the town we take a pretty road through pine
and heath, almond and olive, arbutus and carob, and set
out to visit the old castle of Santuíri. Within half an
hour of our destination the carriage halts, and a rocky
goat-path leads us to the summit of the crag upon which
the ruins stand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Santuíri was one of the great mediæval burgs of Majorca,
and is in far better preservation than either of its fellows
of Alaró or Pollensa. In the fifteenth century its walls
were strengthened against an expected attack of the
Moors, and much of these defences still remains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Proud, and most desolate, is this old sentinel of the
southern coast. Buzzards hang in mid-air beneath the
battlements—brown specks against the dim blue plain
below; sheep graze amongst spurge and St. John’s wort
on the grassy knolls within the fortress. The old gray
walls are trimmed with golden patches of coronilla and
crowned with a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of bristling aloe spikes.
A narrow path cut in the face of the crag, and unprotected
by any parapet, leads to the machicolated gate
tower; above your head there are slits for boiling oil, and
at your back is sudden death in the shape of a precipice,
with nothing to break your fall but the fixed bayonets of
some huge aloes rooted in the crevices of the cliff below.
Assuredly it was well to be on good terms with its lord
when craving admittance to the Castle of Santuíri.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>A twin height across a little valley is occupied by the
Oratorio of San Salvadór—the shrine of a wonder-working
Madonna whose fame dates from the Middle Ages, and
who is visited annually by thousands of pilgrims from all
parts of the island.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this shrine we ascended in the afternoon, the latter
part of the route being a steep hillside, clothed with
prickly pear and a sweet-smelling dwarf gorse, up which
we slowly toiled on foot, the zigzag path marked out with
twelve stations of the Cross, depicted in faïence tiles upon
freestone pillars. Attached to the Oratorio upon the
summit is a large <i>hospedéria</i> containing some forty bedrooms,
built for the reception of pilgrims; the four brown-frocked
friars who minister to the wants of visitors were
busily engaged in sawing timber in the entrance-hall
amidst a litter of fresh shavings, and one of them interrupted
his work to take us into the adjoining chapel. In
pitch darkness we groped our way to a niche at the back
of the high altar, and were shown by the light of a match
a little old stone statue—the Blessed Virgin of San
Salvadór—only second in power to Our Lady of Lluch.</p>

<p class='c013'>A special room is set aside for the votive offerings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>presented to her: the walls are thickly hung with
uniforms, children’s garments, and bridal gowns; there
are toys and medals, and stacks of crutches; there are
rows of photographs of the Virgin’s <i>protégés</i>, who
attribute their escape from accident and illness to her
shielding power; there are crude childish representations
of fires, shipwrecks, thunderbolts, runaway horses, and all
the perils that humanity is heir to. Some of the ex-votos
date from the attack of the Moors in 1737; others come
from far countries—such as the one “promised to Our
Lady in the fire of Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most pathetic offerings that I saw at another
Majorcan shrine was a thick plait of long black hair—“promised
to Our Lady” on such and such a date, doubtless
by some soul in sore need. The belief in miraculous
intervention as an answer to personal sacrifice is deeply
ingrained in the islanders, and is, I should imagine, a
source of much consolation to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>After buying a few rosaries and ribbons bearing the
name of Our Lady of San Salvadór we walked to the end
of a hill-spur where stone seats invite the wayfarer to
rest before beginning the steep descent. The sun was
setting, and the scene before us recalled some Egyptian
evening in its strength of colouring; far beneath us lay
the great dim plain with its white towns, wrapped in the
violet mists of sunset and melting away into the transparent
blues and purples of the distant sierra. The roofs
and walls of the Oratorio and the pine-trees upon the hilltop
stood out in inky relief against a sky stained with
orange and crimson, fiery lake and scarlet; the clouds
were black, glowing coals backed with gold—the whole
heavens were aflame in conflagration.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Long after the glory had faded away a pure, brilliant
glow illuminated the sky and lighted us on our homeward
way, and we returned to Felanitx with the memory of
San Salvadór for ever associated in our minds with the
most beautiful sunset we ever saw in Majorca.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On March 15th we left Felanitx and continued our
journey across the great southern plain. The road to
Manacór runs along a low ridge and commands extensive
views on either hand; asphodels fringed the wayside, and
every patch of waste ground displayed the Spanish colours
in gay yellow daisies and a tiny scarlet ranunculus, the
Adonis vernalis. The weather was glorious; a shower
during the night had laid the dust and cleared the air, and
blue cloud-shadows chased merrily across the landscape.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Bon dia tengan!</i>” comes in cheerful greeting from
the fields where groups of peasant women, in big straw
hats, ply their hoes among the wheat. When they found
we wished to take a photograph of them their amusement
was unbounded, and their merry laughter was
quite infectious.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unceasing is the care of the crops, and unremitting
is the labour bestowed upon the land before it assumes
that market-garden-like neatness that is the ideal of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Majorcan peasant. Centuries of cultivation have converted
much of the land into rich, productive soil, but
a glance at a recently reclaimed field shows one the
difficulties with which the original cultivator has to
contend, difficulties that would surely daunt a less stout-hearted
race. Slabs of bed-rock and countless myriads of
loose stones cover the surface of the ground: by blasting
and patient excavation a certain proportion of these are
removed, and the intervening patches of earth are dug by
hand, the first harvest being represented by a scanty crop
of wheat sprouting in the interstices of the rock paving.
The second or third year it will perhaps be possible to
drive a narrow sharp-pointed ploughshare between the
stones, lifting it briskly out of the ground when the shaft
mule is brought up with a jerk by a more than usually
stubborn boulder. Each year hundreds of tons of loose
stone are collected and disposed of in one way or another;
some are stacked in cairns among the crops and go by the
name of <i>clápers</i>; others are carried with infinite toil to
the boundaries of the field and built into a dry wall a yard
or more thick—coped with the masses of rock that work
up through the soil almost as quickly as they are removed
from the surface; others again are thrown into great stone
reservoirs built for the purpose and filled to the brim with
blocks big and little. Gradually the plague of stones
begins to abate. What one generation has begun, a future
one will accomplish, and eventually the land will assume
the appearance of a rich alluvial plain, and Dame Nature
will put on as benevolent a smile as though she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>proposed from the very first to bountifully reward the
industrious peasant.</p>

<p class='c013'>But always there will be miles upon miles of beautifully
built stone walls to tell a different tale. Truly
may it be said of the Majorcans, as of their Catalonian
forefathers—that from stones they produce bread.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the morning we drove, and by noon we had passed
the town of Manacór and were descending towards the
sea through a silent, sun-steeped land of rock and
asphodel. Asphodels surrounded us for miles, their
starry sceptres swaying in the wind and shining like
silver where the sunlight struck through them. It is
strange that no southern artist has painted us a Madonna
of the Asphodels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down by the seashore stands a small group of freestone
houses called the Port of Manacór, and after
lunching at the <i>fonda</i> we set off on foot to visit the
famous stalactite caves close by. There is nothing in
the surface of the surrounding country to suggest the
existence of vast subterranean caverns; the guide simply
leads the way across the wide moor to a walled enclosure,
where, half concealed by boulders and scrub, a flight of
rock steps leads down to the <i>Cuevas del Drach</i>—the
Dragon Caves of Manacór.</p>

<p class='c013'>Armed with acetylene lanterns we descend, and plunge
into a perfect labyrinth of halls and passages; some of
the scenes are very beautiful; there are “cascades
of diamonds”—frozen falls that sparkle like hoar frost
in the sun—and wonderful statuesque formations under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>fretted canopies fringed with glittering icicles; there
are myriads of stalactites hanging from the roof, some
snow-white and thorny, others like pink glass, that
ring musically when struck with a stone. There is an
immense cavern where one sits down to rest; weird
shadows cast by the lamps dance upon the walls, and
falling drops of water tinkle loudly in the silence.
There are precipices and bottomless pits—into which
the guide tosses stones—and atmospheric lakes, into
which one is liable to walk unawares—the surface of
the water being invisible to the sharpest scrutiny. There
are bright blue pools, crystal clear, in the depths of which
stalagmites appear like white sea-anemones and seem to
mirror back the pendant bosses of the roof. One may
walk for miles and not have seen all, but the heat in
these caves is trying to many people, and one is not
sorry to come out into the cold upper air after spending
an hour or two in a temperature of nearly 90 degrees
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many years ago some Spaniards were lost for days in
the Drach caves, and the spot is still shown where
in their despair they scratched upon the walls: <i>No hay
esperanza</i>—There is no hope!</p>

<p class='c013'>In the caves of Arta, people are said to have entered
who have never been seen again, alive or dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little inn at the <i>Puerto de Manacór</i> is a typical
Majorcan <i>fonda</i>. Our rooms were floored with cheerful
red tiles, and the walls were almost awe-inspiring in their
spotlessness; it is a popular saying that on Saturdays the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Majorcans whitewash everything within reach. From
our windows—furnished with wooden shutters in place
of glass—we looked down upon a vine-covered pergola
and a little bright blue bay encircled by a snow-white
beach. Our beds were good, and the bed-linen excellent—the
lace-trimmed pillow-cases and beautifully embroidered
monograms testifying to the skill with which
the women ply their needle. Supper was served on
the first-floor landing, and consisted of fish, omelette,
chicken and rice, and dessert; and at nine o’clock our
hostess mounted the stairs to inform us that there
would be no milk for our morning coffee unless some
could be procured from Manacór (an hour distant)—the
local dairy being inconsiderate enough to have two
fine kids at the moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>She bade us a friendly good-night, and as an afterthought
pointed out that being in the country here,
it was the custom to empty bedroom basins out of the
window. We promised to avail ourselves of the permission,
and retiring, were gently lulled to sleep by the
rhythmic breathing of the tide below.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It is strange to hear of snow and frost at home while
we are living in a long succession of June days. Under
a cloudless expanse of blue—unbroken save by a transparent
white moon in the eastern sky—did we leave the
<i>Puerto</i> on the morning of March 16th. Retracing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>road to Manacór, we drove through tracts of pine wood
and rosemary, and at midday reached Arta—an oriental-looking
town of white houses and palm-trees—the
<i>Yartan</i> of the Moors, in whose day it was an important
colony. Their principal mosque was converted by the
Conqueror into the great church that stands upon the
hillside and with fortress-like walls and wide-arched
upper gallery dominates the town. Crowning the same
hill is the wall-encircled church of San Salvadór, used
in olden times as a refuge for non-combatants during
Saracen attacks, and in more recent days as a lazaretto
in time of pestilence—which led to its being pulled
down and rebuilt about a hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the vicinity of Arta are to be found certain tumuli
of unknown origin, that correspond more or less to
those monuments of a pre-historic race which exist in
most of the islands of the Mediterranean. In a deserted
olive-yard—where the poisonous <i>solanum sodomacum</i>
trailed its miniature yellow and green melons among
the stones and big, pale periwinkles grew—we came
upon the <i>Clápers de Gegants</i>, or Giants’ Cairns. A
ring wall of large stones weighing several tons apiece
had evidently existed at one time; but most of the
blocks had fallen in, and the central mound—whether
watch tower or burial tumulus—was a mere chaos of
stones and brambles. To any one who has seen the
far finer megalithic monuments of Minorca, no Majorcan
remains will appear of much importance.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>From Arta it is a pretty drive to the castle of Cap
de Péra, an old fortress with portcullised gateway and
peaked Moorish battlements, around which one can
walk on a narrow ledge laid on stone brackets. Prickly
pear and masses of crimson and white stocks run riot
within the walls and cluster about the little chapel of
the summit. Beyond the castle the road winds by a
steep ascent to the lighthouse of the Cap de Péra—built
upon the extreme eastern point of the island, whence
a splendid view is obtained, the low coastline of Minorca
being dimly discernible far out at sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>At nine o’clock the following morning we set out for
the stalactite caves of Arta—said to be the most
wonderful ones in the world, with the exception of
certain caverns in New South Wales. For an hour
and a half we descended towards the coast through
a plain of fig orchards and palmetto clumps—the latter
portion of the route being a mere cart-track of surprising
badness—and finally drew up under a grove of picturesque
old <i>Pinus maritima</i> near the seashore—the
finest trees we had yet seen in an island where good
timber is rare.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fifteen minutes’ walk along a cliff path, with a
turquoise blue sea below, and the scent of pines and
gorse filling the warm air, and we come to the entrance
to the caves. A great cleft opens in the face of the cliff
overhead—a natural ante-chamber to the caves, supported
by Herculean pillars of live rock, and to this we ascend by
a long flight of massive stone steps, as though to the portals
of some grand old Egyptian temple. Following our guide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>we pass through an iron <i>grille</i> and descend through cool
depths of grey rock till we seem to have reached the very
heart of the hills.</p>

<p class='c013'>So strange is the under world through which one is led
for the next two hours that at times one doubts whether
it is not all a dream. Now we wander through lofty
halls hung from roof to floor with stony curtain folds,
where tall stalagmitic palm-trees stand in groups—their
rugged stems hard as marble, white as though bleached
by long confinement in these sunless caves. Now we
seem to be exploring a coral world in the depths of the
sea, and half expect to meet startled fishes darting hither
and thither among the fantastically sculptured grots and
low-fretted arches through which we creep. Now we
enter the great hall of columns, and wait in darkness
upon a high rock-platform, while our invisible guide
busies himself below with Bengal lights. Suddenly a
vista of gigantic columns leaps out of black space,
monstrous shadows retreat into a perspective of infinite
extent, and—as though in some strange operatic scene—we
find ourselves standing in a great vaulted crypt,
Gothic in its indescribable richness of architectural detail,
Egyptian in its gigantic proportions and massive grandeur.
Still larger is the great cavern known as the Cathedral,
the roof of which attains a height of a hundred and fifty
feet; so weird and grand beyond belief is the effect created
by this vast interior when lighted up—so wonderful is the
mimicry of hangings and sculpture—so regular the slender
turrets and fretted pinnacles that enrich the structure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>that it is difficult to realise that the scene before one is
Nature’s own handiwork.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wending our way down the Devil’s Staircase we next
descend to a spot below sea-level to visit the “lost souls”—a
company of black and burnt-up looking little figures
seated beside a salt-water pool that goes by the name
of the Styx. Endless is the imagery suggested by the
stalactite formations; some resemble isolated statues,
others intricate groups of Hindu gods. There is an organ
with musical pipes, there are strange echoes that live far
away among the rock caverns of the roof, and huge lurking
shadows that—startled by the light of our lanterns—glide
swiftly out of their recesses and disappear into the
darkness ahead. But always we return to the aisles of
ghostly columns that distinguish these caves from all
others I have ever seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Questioned as to the presumed age of these columns our
guide throws up his hands in despair, and, leading us to
a small stalagmite in process of formation, shows us a
couple of copper <i>sous</i> embedded in its glassy surface;
it is twenty years since they were placed there, and in
that time the stalagmite has risen to the rims of the coins
and they are now fixed in their place by the most delicate
silver film. Allowing fifteen <i>sous</i> to the inch, a rough
computation sets the rate of growth of this particular
stalagmite at something between three and four thousand
years to the foot—a period doubtless considerably exceeded
in the case of the larger columns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gem of the whole collection is the great palm-tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>that stands alone in one of the outer courts. There are
others that equal it in girth—its stem measures little
more than three feet in diameter—but its splendid shaft
ascends flawless, joint above joint of white coral-like
stalagmite, till it unites with the roof sixty or seventy
feet above the level of the floor. Since the world was
young it has stood in these Halls of Silence—a silence
of æons, broken only by dropping water and occasional
earthquake shocks that have flung masses of stalactite
to the ground. These horizontal rings in its stem may
have been deposited in the days of palæolithic man; while
that joint was being formed Babylon and Nineveh rose
and passed away, and the Pharaohs in long procession
filed across the world’s stage and vanished.</p>

<p class='c013'>The falling drop has now finished its work and has
shifted to another spot where it has begun the base of
a second column. Some day the capital of this one also
will be completed....</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a glimpse into Eternity that appals one.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On March 18th we left Arta. A hum and a buzz in
the street proclaimed it Sunday morning, and on emerging
from our inn we found a couple of hundred people—including
two Civil Guards and all the elders of the place—assembled
to see us off. This interest was centred less
in ourselves than in our victoria, for to people whose only
notion of a carriage is the Spanish one of the baker’s-cart
pattern, the sight of so long, low, and altogether remarkable
looking a vehicle was of thrilling interest. It was
probably the first ever seen in this part of the island,
and had it been a motor-car it could not have made
a greater sensation. Beasts of burden bolted at so
novel an apparition, mules in carts swerved violently;
children would drag their small brothers and sisters
half a mile across country to catch a glimpse of us,
and we brought whole village populations running to
their doors.</p>

were returning from Mass, with men and women seated
upon sacks at the bottom of the vehicles; but the fields
were deserted save for an occasional swineherd tending
his beasts among the carob groves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Near Sineu we passed a large corral of young mules
with their mothers; so proudly do these quaint, long-eared
infants follow the handsome black mares that one
is irresistibly reminded of the inquiry put by an interested
listener to the man who was boasting of his mother’s
beauty—“C’était donc Monsieur votre père qui n’était pas
beau?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The night was spent at Sineu, and returning to Palma
the following morning we settled down at the Grand
Hotel for a week before starting on our second driving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>tour, which was to introduce us to the North-western
corner of the island.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>For the next few days the weather behaved as badly
as it occasionally will do in southern lands where its
reputation is at stake. The Palma natives became first
apologetic, then exasperated;—“Fie, for shame!” screamed
an old woman angrily, addressing the rain from her shop
door where we had taken shelter in a downpour—“Fie,
for shame! What, then, will the English ladies think
of us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the spirit of perversity had entered into the Spring;
she sprinkled snow upon the mountains, and kept the
mail-boats imprisoned at Barcelona; she drenched the
shivering population till the very swallows sat disconsolately
on the clothes lines, drooping their wet wings;
and she persisted in making such ugly threatening faces
that it looked as if we should never start for Andraitx
at all. Reason certainly pointed to our remaining at
Palma; we were warm and comfortable at the Grand
Hotel—we got far better food than we ever did on our
travels, and the Dark-room itself was more commodious
than might be our future quarters in some village <i>fonda</i>.
On the other hand time was passing, and we had yet
much to see; finally we decided to risk all and to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>The heavens were black with clouds when we set off
on the morning of March 27th, but before we had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>gone half an hour our lucky star shone out, and the
weather executed a complete <i>volte-face</i> such as one is led
to believe any climate but our own would be ashamed of.
Brilliant sunshine dried up the puddles with that amazing
rapidity peculiar to porous soils, and the day suddenly
decided to be quite, quite fine.</p>

<p class='c013'>So excellent may be the results obtained from flying
in the face of Providence—if only it be done at the right
moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Merrily our little horses jingled along the splendid
<i>carretera real</i>—the royal road—that leads to Andraitx;
now we follow the coastline and catch glimpses of blue
waves and fringes of white foam between the stems of
the pine-trees; now we turn inland among the olive
groves—where the old trees pirouette airily or stand with
feet gracefully crossed upon the hill slopes, amidst pink
and white cistus and bushes of wild mignonette. In
three hours we reach Andraitx, where the carriage road
terminates, and having no further use for our victoria we
send it back to Palma, with instructions to meet us the
next day but one at the village of Estallenchs beyond the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Andraitx, the old Andrachium of the Romans, is a
prosperous-looking town lying in a green valley of almond
orchards; most of the inhabitants are sea-faring folk,
and down by the shore—five miles distant—we found a
little colony of houses where fishermen in red Phrygian
caps were mending their nets until the gale should abate.
It was assuredly no day to put out to sea so long as white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>foam was running up the face of the cliffs, driven by a
wild west wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The church of Andraitx is one of the oldest in the
island; it stands upon rising ground above the town, its
great blank walls plain—even in a land of plain exteriors;
and beside it stands the fine old Possession-house of
<i>Son Mās</i>, said to date back to the time of the Moors.
The Possession-houses of Majorca were originally the
country seats of the Spanish nobility; once inhabited by
the great landowners, they have now descended to the
level of farmhouses and have become the residence of
the principal tenant farmer upon the estate, who goes by
the name of the Amo, or master. These fine old buildings
usually stand in the centre of some large property,
and are almost invariably fortified and adapted to stand
a siege.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very picturesque is the straggling yellow pile of <i>Son
Mās</i>, with its high walls and machicolated tower. Passing
under a heavy stone archway we cross a large courtyard,
where pigeons are stepping through stately minuets upon
a vine pergola, and ascend by a flight of steps to a broad
open gallery, supported on pillars, that runs along the
front of the house. We are shown the spacious kitchen
and living rooms of the present occupants, and are then
led through suite after suite of disused apartments—whitewashed,
stone-flagged, shuttered, given up to bats
and cobwebs. In the rooms occupied by the Señor, when
on rare occasions he pays a visit to his estate, are a few
pieces of the old furniture—some wooden chests, such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>take the place of wardrobes in Majorcan households, a
carved bedstead, and a few old paintings—fast going to
decay. Soon there will be nothing save the stone
scutcheon in the courtyard to preserve the memory of
the founder of <i>Son Mās</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Behind the house is an enormous reservoir containing a
water supply that would outlast any conceivable siege to
which the inhabitants might be subjected. The cement
roof of the tank forms a wide terrace—some ninety by
thirty feet—and two well-shafts, thickly lined with maidenhair
fern, give access to the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>A winding staircase leads to the summit of the old
watch-tower, where from an open <i>loggia</i> under the roof
the besieged could hurl down missiles upon the foe before
the gate. In an unguarded moment I attempted the
ascent of this tower, and never shall I forget the sensation
of that climb; losing sight of my feet from the very
start—my head being always three turns higher up the
steps—and momentarily expecting to stick fast for good,
I thrust myself in spirals up the narrowest corkscrew
stairs it has ever been my fate to encounter. Judging
by my own sensations I should guess the staircase to
have measured nine inches in width—but it is possible
it may have been rather more.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we sat at supper that evening there came a knock
at the door and the <i>Alcalde</i> was announced; a shy little
man fingering a felt hat slipped into the room and made
us a low bow; he was the Burgomaster, come to pay his
respects and to inquire if we had all we wanted. While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>entirely appreciating the kindness that prompted his
visit we could willingly have dispensed with it, on account
of the immense exertion required to express ourselves in
Spanish at all, and the impossibility of doing so as we
should wish. We gathered that he was placing himself
and all he possessed at our disposal, and we did our best
to rise to the occasion; but sentiments of gratitude are
sadly lamed by a limited vocabulary. We tried to improve
our position by asking if he could speak French, and
expressing our disappointment when he negatived the
question. The interview was punctuated by rather
painful silences—and it was with a certain sense of relief
that we saw our friendly visitor bow himself out again
on being assured there was nothing he could do for us.</p>

<p class='c013'>All that night a terrific storm raged. Mingled with
the rattling of hail and the crash of thunder came the
sound of the <i>Sereno</i> hammering at the house door to
wake the <i>fondista</i>, and shortly afterwards we heard the
latter come upstairs and pound lustily upon the door of
an adjoining bedroom; some señor had to be called to
catch the diligence, which—according to Spanish custom—leaves
Andraitx at the extraordinary hour of two o’clock
in the morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time we had finished breakfast the sun was
shining hotly once more, and we were able to start for
San Telmo. Seated in a small <i>carreta</i>—a very light
skeleton cart on two wheels, with rush mats spread over
the bars of the bottom and sides—we set out at a foot’s
pace to visit the old castle on the coast, an hour and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>half distant. For a mile or so one ascends by a very
steep mountain road, but after crossing the <i>col</i> this road
deteriorates into the roughest of cart tracks, winding
down to the sea through a valley of pine-trees, olives, and
carobs.</p>

<p class='c013'>A country road in Majorca may mean anything—from
a tract of bedrock scattered with loose stones of any size,
to a soft, uneven hill-path, barely wide enough for a
wheeled vehicle to pass. Short of coming to actual
steps, a <i>carreta</i> is expected to follow anywhere where a
pony can obtain a footing, and many a time did the
bumps and lurches to which we were subjected recall
George Sand’s driving experiences in the year 1838.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking of what is now one of the finest roads in the
island she narrates in lively French how in her day the
journey was perilously accomplished—“with one wheel
on the mountain and one in the ravine.... The jolting
is indescribable ... yet however frightful a concussion
the driver receives, he sings all the time in a loud voice—only
breaking off to bestow curses upon his horse if the
animal hesitates for an instant before plunging down some
precipice or climbing some rock wall.... For it is thus
one proceeds—ravines, torrents, quagmires, ditches,
hedges, all present themselves in vain—one does not stop
for so little. Besides, it is all part of the road; at first
you think you must be steeplechasing for a wager, and
you ask your driver what possesses him. This is the road,
he replies. But that river? It is the road. And this
deep pit? The road. And that bush also? Always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the road.... <i>A la bonne heure!</i> And all that remains
for you to do is to commend your soul to God and to
contemplate the landscape, while awaiting death or a
miracle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Descending from the <i>carreta</i> shortly after starting, to
lighten the load of the floundering pony, I had at first
persuaded the stout proprietor to follow my example;
but within a very short time he had climbed in again,
observing with a loud gasp that the way was long. It
was not the first time he had been to San Telmo; only a
year ago he had driven two English ladies there, and they
too had had a camera, and on the way it fell out of the
cart and was lost. To this day he could remember their
lamentable cries of “La máquina, la máquina!” But
five days later it was picked up by an old man, who
thought it was a bomb and carried it home very cautiously.
The ladies were very pleased—oh yes, they gave him
more than a day’s wages for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little castle of San Telmo was built in the sixteenth
century for the protection of Andraitx. It stands on a
rocky prominence by the seashore, and is in good preservation,
its barrel-vaulted dining hall serving as a
workshop for the old man who lives there. From the
flat roof of the tower, where rusty cannon still occupy
the embrasures, one looks down upon a pretty beach,
where long green waves, lit up by the sun, break gently
upon the sand, and great conch shells are sometimes
found amongst the foam fringes of the surf. Some three
hundred yards out from the shore is the low turtle-backed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>rock Pentaleu, where the Conqueror first set foot on
quitting his storm-tossed galley; and screening the
northern side of the little bay are the bare grey flanks—dreaded
by sailors—of the Dragonéra, Majorca’s
westernmost outpost. A lighthouse occupies the knife-like
ridge of the summit, and cutting along through the
Freu—the narrow strait between the island rock and the
mainland—comes a little white steamer, the Barcelona
boat, bringing a welcome cargo of mails after a silence
that has lasted more than a week.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following morning, March 29th, we set out for
Estallenchs, our cavalcade consisting of one riding mule
and a sturdy donkey to carry the luggage. No expedition
could have offered a greater contrast to our tour of the
preceding week than did this journey across the mountains.
On the southern plain a whole day’s march of
thirty miles is accomplished in a morning’s drive; in the
Sierra we take four hours to cover a distance of twelve
miles. Up and down among the hills winds the mule
track; now we are high above the lapis lazuli sea, on a
mountain path knee deep in palmetto fans and the red-velvet
flower of lentiscus bushes; now we descend to a
torrent bed hemmed in by great grey cliffs scarred with
red scarps where part of the hillside has broken off and
poured like an avalanche into the bed of the valley. Now
we enter the pine woods where the white allium and many
orchises grow, and the air is fragrant with rosemary and
gorse. Further on we come to a winding rock staircase
cut in the face of the cliff, down which, our guide tells us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>it is not safe to ride; the only surprising thing is that any
animal except a goat should be expected to descend it;
and here our baggage donkey distinguished himself by
slipping down and lying motionless, but quite unhurt,
till he was unloaded and dragged on to his legs again.</p>

<p class='c013'>A rough cart track winds for some way into these
lonely hills, and we meet timber carts descending with
loads of fir-trees, the mules stumbling and sliding on
their haunches down the steep hillside—the heavy two-wheeled
carts, with powerful brakes on, crashing and
jolting behind them over boulders and tree-stumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we approach human habitations again, traces of
cultivation once more appear; small terraces are levelled
on the mountain side and planted with almond-trees, from
which our men snatch handfuls of young milky nuts in
passing—a universal habit that has given rise to the
sarcastic proverb, “The laden almond-tree by the wayside
is sure to be bitter.” At last, after a long and fatiguing
descent by shallow paved steps, we come in sight of
Estallenchs—a pretty village nestling in a fold of the
hills, backed by cliffs, grey peaks of sun and shadow; in
front a valley opening down to the sea, with hill slopes
clothed in almond, olive, and fir.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inn is a very humble building, and does not even
entitle itself a <i>fonda</i>. The master of the house was
absent, and the old woman left in charge spoke no
Spanish; we spoke no Majorcan, and by way of facilitating
conversation she suddenly sent an urgent message
to the village doctor, who arrived post haste, thinking
that some accident had befallen the English señoras.
Somewhat dashed at finding us both uninjured and in
good health, he yet conversed with us very pleasantly in
our attic chamber, offered to show us the place, translated
various requests for us, and before leaving ordered our
dinner. Thanks to his ministrations we lacked for
nothing that night, the only hitch occurring at bedtime,
when our best efforts to obtain candles resulted in a dish
of olives being set before us.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The following morning a cheerful jingle of bells
announces the arrival of our good Pépé and the victoria;
the approach to the inn being too narrow for a carriage
to pass, our belongings are carried up to the main road
and there bestowed upon the box. Village dames look
on from their doorways and nod affably, and one of them
invited us to come in while waiting for the carriage to be
packed, and took the deepest interest in our proceedings
when we proposed photographing her room—only regretful
that her floor was not yet covered with the tiles she
showed us stacked in readiness. The only light streamed
through the great stone archway of the outer door, and
revealed the usual spotless interior of a Majorcan house,
the walls snowy with repeated coats of whitewash.
Good string-seated chairs and stools were ranged neatly
round the room, and on the shelves stood the graceful
water-jars in daily use among the people. Boxwood
spoons and forks hung in a rack by the chimney corner,
and over a clear fire of almond-shells upon the hearth
bubbled a pot of bean soup; nothing would content the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>good housewife but that we should taste it—and most
excellent it was. Everything about the place was tidy
and exquisitely clean.</p>

<p class='c013'>You might search in Majorca for a long time I fancy
before you would find a slattern.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scale of wages in the island is low—a labourer
rarely earning more than eighteen pence a day; but
there is every sign of general prosperity. The necessaries
of life are very cheap, and a well-built stone house can
be obtained in country villages at a rental of from two to
three pounds a year.</p>

<p class='c013'>The drive from Estallenchs to Bañalbufár is—from the
point of view of scenery—one of the finest in the island;
high above the sea runs the road, following every curve
of the rugged coast; dark, fir-crowned cliffs tower overhead,
and mountain ranges in splendid perspective jut
out into the blue Mediterranean. Headland upon headland,
point upon point—each intervening bay outlined
with a semicircle of snow-white foam—they stretch
back to where the faint blue battering-ram of the
Dragonéra is still dimly visible in the haze of distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perched on a rock pinnacle above the sea stand the
yellow walls of an old watch tower; these towers, or
<i>ataláyas</i> as they are called, were in olden days tenanted
by coastguards, who from their lofty eyries watched the
sea and gave the alarm to the countryside when any
suspicious sail appeared on the horizon; a system of
smoke-signals was in use by which the movements of
a hostile fleet could be communicated to all the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>ataláyas</i> along the coast and to the inhabitants of the
interior.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bañalbufár is a small village built upon a mountain
slope high above the sea, chiefly noticeable for the
marvellous terracing of the surrounding hillsides; the
terraces are so narrow and the walls so high that seen
from below the effect is that of an unbroken stone wall
several hundred feet in height, while from a little distance
they resemble a gigantic flight of curved steps or
an inverted amphitheatre upon the hillside. Vines and
tomatoes are largely grown by the industrious inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down by the sea, in the cavernous recesses of overhanging
rocks, are some curious corn mills, to which one
descends by a steep paved path, the tiny mountain
stream that works the mills raging and sluicing alongside
in a polished aqueduct at such prodigious speed
that upon touching the water your hand receives a smart
blow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here upon a small headland below the village we ate
our luncheon, among clumps of purple stock and bushes
of bright green spurge—devouring the while a week’s
budget of letters that Pépé had brought out with him;
after which we rejoined our carriage and began the long
ascent of the Col that lay between us and Palma. Like
a snake does the white road wind in loops up the mountain
side; the <i>Pinus maritima</i> clothes the hill slopes
to the very summit, but rarely attains an even respectable
size. In this respect Majorca differs strikingly
from Corsica, where grand forests of Laricio pine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>flourish in the rockiest of soils. Natural timber is indeed
a feature entirely lacking in the greater part of Majorca,
owing to the fact that whenever it is in any way possible
to utilise the ground it is devoted to the more profitable
culture of the olive and almond.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaving the mountains behind us we presently pass
Esporlás, with its rushing stream bordered by Lombardy
poplars, and its great cloth factory, where hanks of dyed
cotton are hanging out to dry; and soon after reaching
Establiments—a trim and prosperous townlet nine kilometres
from Palma—the rain comes down in torrents.
We meet flocks of drenched sheep, and tilted country
carts returning from market, each carter fast asleep
inside, with his head on a pile of sacks and a blanket
drawn up to his chin, leaving all responsibility to the
sagacious mule who steps aside to let us pass. The
wheat fields are dripping, the wet air is heavy with the
scent of flowering may, and Palma itself is spanned by
a bright rainbow. Let it rain! we are back in comfortable
quarters once more!</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On the 2nd of April we went to spend a few days at
Sollér—the one inevitable expedition for all visitors to
Palma. By the most direct route the drive only occupies
three hours, but it is best to make a <i>détour</i> by way of
Valldemósa and Miramár, so as to include the beautiful
scenery of the north coast.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Long and straight and flat is the road to Valldemósa,
the cornfields on either side decked out with blue borage,
gladiolus, and pink allium, and bordered with a fringe
of flaring yellow daisies—the kind known in English
gardens as annual chrysanthemums. A brilliant touch
of colour is given by a row of bright vermilion flower-pots,
set out on the snow-white parapet of a country
house; but actual flower gardens are as lacking among
the homesteads of Majorca as among those of most
southern lands—and the peasants would no doubt
marvel greatly at the sentiment which induces an
English cottager to allot so much valuable space to
flowers when he might devote it to the utilitarian
onion or the practical potato.</p>

<p class='c013'>A couple of hours’ drive brings one to the foot of the
mountains, and passing through a fine gorge the road
ascends to the village of Valldemósa, perched upon a
saddle among the hills. It was here that in the sixteenth
century Santa Catalina was born—the pious
maiden who on her walks used the leaves of the olive
and lentisk as rosaries, and who from her cell heard
mass being celebrated in Palma Cathedral, ten miles
distant; but Valldemósa’s chief claim to fame lies in
her great Carthusian monastery, a huge yellow pile
occupying the ridge above the village. Originating as
the summer palace of the Moorish rulers of Majorca,
the great building was subsequently used as a residence
by the kings of Aragon, and it was not till the year 1400
that it fell into the hands of the monks; fortified,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>restored, and added to at various times, the monastery
eventually covered an enormous area of ground, and
sufficient still remains to amaze us at the lavish style
in which twelve Carthusian friars and their Father
Superior were housed.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the monastery was suppressed in 1835, the
Spanish government made over the newer wing of
the building to private persons, and nine Majorcan
families occupy the monks’ old quarters to this day.
Very charming are these monastic residences, entered
from the cool, whitewashed cloisters; each set of rooms
is quite secluded from the rest, and each has its small
terrace garden to the south, where lemon-trees bask in
the sunshine, screened by the high walls that divide
each monk’s territory from that of his neighbour on
either side. From the low parapet in front one looks
out over a steep declivity of orange groves and ranges
of hills stretching down to the gorge—the gate of the
plains.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in one of these apartments that George Sand
passed the winter when she visited the island with her
two children in the year 1838, accompanied by the
invalid Chopin. The accommodation provided for one
Carthusian friar—three good-sized rooms and a kitchen
on the ground floor, with as many bedrooms above stairs—afforded
ample living room for the party of four; but
the winter proved bitterly cold, and all the comforts
of a northern home were lacking in an island where
open fireplaces are unknown, and a brazier filled with
charcoal is the only means of warming a room. At
great expense an iron stove was brought up to Valldemósa
and installed in one of the rooms, where it
smelt abominably. In other matters the unfortunate
strangers were no happier; the grand piano—imported
from France—gave such endless trouble at the Palma
customs that they would willingly have had it sunk
in the harbour—but even that was not permitted. It
was only after protracted wrangling that it was finally
liberated upon the payment of four hundred francs.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The attitude of the Valldemósans too was anything
but pleasant or conciliatory to the French exiles; the
expulsion of the monks was too recent for them to have
become reconciled to the occupation of the monastery
by lay residents, and they looked with intense suspicion
on these foreigners who never came to church and who
scandalised society by allowing a little girl of nine to
roam the country attired in rational costume.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were doubtless faults on both sides; if the
peasants regarded George Sand as a heathen, she looked
upon them as uncharitable and bigoted barbarians, and
she contrasts the result of their so-called religion with
the abomination of desolation of philosophy in which—as
she ironically remarks—her own children were
brought up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Life in Majorca seems to have offered few attractions
to the foreigner in those days; setting aside the
difficulties of transit—difficulties rendered doubly trying
in the case of an invalid—the discomfort of the pig-boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>by which one came to Palma, and the shocking
state of the roads, to which I have previously alluded—setting
all this aside, the very character of the islanders
seems to have been radically different when George Sand
sojourned amongst them from what it is now. According
to her, the Majorcans were dirty and impertinent;
they cheated one shamelessly at every turn; they were
calculating, selfish, and utterly heartless where their
own interest was concerned; letters of recommendation
to twenty Palma residents would hardly suffice to
prevent a stranger from wandering homeless about the
town on arrival; and if any luckless foreigner presumed
to complain of the treatment he received, or so
much as ventured to express disapproval at the presence
of scorpions in his soup, a torrent of indignation and
contempt descended on his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now our own impressions of the Majorcans differed
so wholly from the above description that it is difficult to
realise that the writer was referring to the same people.
Our experience of the island was, however, necessarily
a brief and superficial one—and though I have endeavoured
faithfully to record all that befell us on our travels
I am open to the charge of having taken too <i>couleur-de-rose</i>
a view, or—in the more pithy Minorcan phrase—of
having unconsciously resembled “the ass of Moro, who
was enchanted with everything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I therefore quote the following words written by one
not open to this charge—the Austrian Archduke Louis
Salvator, who for more than twenty years made the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>his home, who travelled about among the peasants, and
who probably knows the island and its inhabitants more
intimately than do most of the natives themselves:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Majorcans,” he writes, “are gentle, cheerful,
open-hearted, compassionate, and charitable to the poor;
faithful in friendship, and extremely attached to their
wives and children; <em>very hospitable, like all the Balearic
peoples</em>—this applies to rich and poor alike, who all heap
kindness upon the stranger and entertain him with their
best.”</p>

<p class='c013'>How to reconcile this opinion with that of George
Sand I do not know—for it is not usual for the racial
characteristics of an island people to alter so completely
in fifty years. I can only imagine that the French
authoress must have arrived in Majorca at an inauspicious
moment; that she unintentionally roused the animosity
of her neighbours, and that she may have been actually
unlucky in the people with whom she came in contact;
while anxiety over the condition of her sick friend did not
improve her temper. It must not be supposed, however,
that her winter at Valldemósa was one long Jeremiad;
she thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of the scenery and the
flowers, and her vivid imagination, her spirit, and her
sense of humour carried her through trials that would
have depressed many another person.</p>

<p class='c013'>An apology is due to her memory for the deliberate
charge brought against her in Murray’s guide-book of
having damaged a certain “priceless historical document”
during her stay in the island. The document in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>question is a curious illuminated map of Europe and the
north coast of Africa, made for Amerigo Vespucci in the
year 1439 by a Majorcan draughtsman; and George Sand
is most unjustly held up to the reprobation of all future
travellers as having obtained permission to copy this map,
and as having upset her inkpot over it.</p>

<p class='c013'>That an inkpot <em>was</em> upset over it she herself records in
dramatic narration, but her account of the affair goes to
show that she had neither part nor lot in bringing about
the accident; her hair stands on end with horror as she
recalls the scene....</p>

<p class='c013'>She was being shown the library collected by Cardinal
Despuig, uncle to the then Count of Montenegro, when
the house-chaplain volunteered to show her the precious
map—the gem of the collection. Spreading it on a table
he unrolled the beautiful illuminated parchment—whereon
large cities share the Sahara with equally large savages
mounted on camels; but the vellum was reluctant to
remain flat, seeing which, a servant placed a full inkstand
upon a corner of the map to keep it open. But alas! its
weight was insufficient! The scroll gave a crack—a leap—and
lo! it was again rolled up, <em>with the inkstand inside</em>!</p>

<p class='c013'>Horror and confusion reigned; the chaplain fainted
away; the servants were petrified—and then, losing their
heads, dashed up with sponges, brooms, and pails of
water, and fell upon the map with zeal so fatal that kingdoms,
oceans, isles, and continents were overwhelmed in
common ruin.</p>

<p class='c013'>George Sand declares she was not even touching the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>table at the moment of the catastrophe—but adds prophetically
that she quite supposes the blame of it will
to all time be laid at her door. The map was subsequently
restored by skilful hands to nearly its pristine
glory, and is now to be seen under glass in the house
of the Count of Montenegro at Palma.</p>

<p class='c013'>The big monastery-church of Valldemósa contains little
of interest beyond some good marble mosaics, and hanging
on the wall is a curious apparatus not unlike a pool-marker,
with lettered pegs that fit into holes—the talking
board used by the silent monks when they wished to
communicate with one another.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Valldemósa an hour’s drive brings one to
Miramár, the large estate purchased in 1872 by the
Archduke Louis Salvator. Before arriving at the house
itself one passes the roadside <i>hospedéria</i>, kept up—with
true Majorcan hospitality—by the lord of the manor for
the benefit of travellers: free quarters for three days, with
firing, salt, and olives, are offered to all comers, and the
woman in charge cooks the food that visitors bring with
them. This hospice makes an excellent centre from
which to explore the north coast of the island, and good
walkers would discover countless delightful rambles
amongst the pinewoods that clothe the cliffs down to
the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Archduke’s own house is a plain building standing
2,000 feet above sea-level; the name Miramár—Sea View—has
attached to the site ever since the thirteenth century,
when Don Jaime II.—acting on the recommendation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Rámon Lull, his seneschal—founded a college there.
Never was a name better deserved; like a silver mirror the
placid Mediterranean lies outspread below one, its motionless
surface flecked with tiny fishing boats; dark, fir-clad
cliffs slope precipitously to the sea, and far below lies the
red rock Foradada like some gigantic saurian in the blue
water. Look-out points, or <i>Miradórs</i>, are constructed in
various parts of the grounds, commanding glorious views;
and perched upon a rocky spur lower down the hill is a
tiny chapel, recently built, dedicated to St. Rámon Lull.
One of its foundation stones was brought from Bougie in
Algeria—where the saint met his death by stoning—and
another from San Francisco, in memory of the missionary
Juan Serra, the Majorcan founder of the Pacific city.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the last eight years the Archduke has not resided
at his Majorcan home, greatly to the regret of the people;
the house is uninhabited, but is shown to visitors by the
caretaker.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its chief interest consists in the entirely native character
of its contents; everything in the house is Majorcan—the
thick, soft matting on the floors, the string-seated rocking-chairs
and the fat stools of stuffed basket-work; the handsome
brass braziers and the carved four-post bedsteads;
the inlaid chests and cabinets, and the splendid collection
of faïence ware, of which the owner is a connoisseur.
Majorcan too is the vulture in the garden—a fierce, brown
bird, who hisses at visitors, and jumps wrathfully from
branch to branch of the aviary in which he has lived for
seventeen long years.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The Archduke is the author of a very exhaustive and
profusely illustrated work on the Balearics, “<i>Die Balearen
in Wort und Bild</i>”; but unfortunately it is too costly
a work to become generally known, or it would bring
many travellers to visit the islands which the author
loves so well.</p>

<p class='c013'>On leaving Miramár we continue along the coast to
Deya, a picturesque village of clustered houses and steep
streets of steps, perched upon an isolated peak and
backed by high mountains. Here we caught sight of a
strange figure striding along the road ahead of us, and
presently we came up with a holy palmer, who might
have stepped straight out of the twelfth century—with
cockleshells and staff, and with his sandal shoon. He
was posting along at five miles an hour with a dog at his
heels.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whither away, O Father?” we asked with respectful
salutation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Over the whole world, my children,” replied the old
man, turning upon us a rugged face framed in long grey
locks.</p>

<p class='c013'>We learnt that he was a native of Spain, and had for
years been on a pilgrimage to the most sacred shrines in
all lands; he had been in the Holy Land and in Egypt—had
visited St. James of Compostella, and Rome, and
Lourdes—and now was on his way to the shrine of Our
Lady of Lluch. His wallet contained his papers—viséd
at his various halting places—together with a few
treasured relics from the Holy Sepulchre; of money he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>had no need, since the faithful everywhere would give
him food and a night’s lodging, for the labourer is worthy
of his hire. But he dare not tarry, for he had yet far to
go, and with a “<i>Buen viaje!</i>” we drove on and soon lost
sight of the solitary pilgrim who in this strange fashion
was working out his own salvation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The town of Sollér lies almost at sea-level, in a
spacious valley ringed round with mountains around
whose grey peaks buzzards and ravens—dwarfed by
distance to the size of midges—circle and slant for ever
to and fro.</p>

<p class='c013'>Warm and sheltered, rich with orange and lemon
groves, date palms and loquats, and entirely enclosed
with hills but for an opening down to the little port on
the north, Sollér is Majorca’s garden of the Hesperides.
Though it is only April 3rd, the roses are running riot in
the gardens of <i>Son Angelāts</i>, a fine house on the outskirts
of the town belonging to a Marchésa who only resides
there in summer time; it has terraces overlooking Sollér,
and large grounds laid out with orange groves, tall palms,
and flowering shrubs; roses cover the terrace walls and
climb up into the grey olive-trees from whence they fall
back in festoons—and the gardener breaks off branch
after branch for us as we go along, great yellow Marshal
Niels, pink La France, crimson tea roses, butter-coloured
Banksias, miniature <i>roses de Meaux</i>, and fragrant Madame
Falcot; we have more roses than we can carry. The
borders are full of pansies and polyanthus, Parma violets
and carnations; we are given bouquets of spirea, freesias,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>peonies, and heliotrope, and we drive away with our little
<i>carreta</i> decked out as if for the Carnival.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Marchésa has beautiful grounds—carriages and
horses, and many servants; and to these possessions she
adds, with true Southern incongruity, a most remarkable
approach to her entrance gate; several yards of decayed
cobble paving—bestrewn with loose blocks of stone and
full of deep holes—over which a small stream swirls
rapidly, intervene between her carriage gate and the
road outside. The bumps and crashes with which our
cart forded the water nearly threw the pony down, and
we feared at one time that a wheel was coming off, but
we got through intact. That the marchioness should
enjoy this episode as part of her daily drive strikes even
the natives, I think, as a little strange.</p>

<p class='c013'>The modest little hotel <i>La Marina</i> at Sollér is a great
improvement on the ordinary village <i>fonda</i>; the cooking
is good, the bedrooms plainly but suitably furnished, and
the proprietor and his daughters spare no pains to make
their guests happy. Mules can be procured in the town
for mountain expeditions, a carriage and pair is kept for
hire, and there is a toy <i>carreton</i> belonging to the hotel
in which one may drive out alone—feeling somewhat like
a coster going to the Derby; the minute white pony
hurries one along at extraordinary speed and stops for
nothing but the Majorcan word of command—Poke-a-parg!</p>

<p class='c013'>The port of Sollér, about half an hour distant, is a little
land-locked harbour with a fishing village of narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>streets and picturesque houses. Majorca’s northern coast
is in general so precipitous and inhospitable that the safe
anchorage offered by the Sollér harbour was a great
attraction to the corsairs of the Middle Ages, and many
and terrible were the struggles that took place in the sixteenth
century between them and the inhabitants of
Sollér; on one of these occasions they sacked and then
burnt to the ground the great Oratory of Santa Catalina,
which stands on a headland at the mouth of the harbour.
After this a castle was built, whose guns commanded the
entrance to the port; but of this nothing remains except
part of a tower, now incorporated in a modern dwelling-house.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are many expeditions to be made on foot and on
muleback into the mountains that surround Sollér;
stalwarts can make the ascent of the snow-crowned
<i>Puig Mayor</i>—Majorca’s highest peak, five thousand feet
above sea-level—or visit the <i>Gorch Blau</i>, a ten hours’
expedition, with several miles of rock steps to come
down on the way back, but both of these require strength
and endurance. Then there is the <i>Barránco</i>, a ravine,
clean cut as with a knife, upon the summit of a grey
mountain ridge from whence a splendid view is obtained;
and there is the <i>Torrent de Pareys</i> on the north coast, to
be reached by boat on a calm day in about two hours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Of the shorter excursions one well worth making is to
the hill village of Fornalutx; the road runs up the valley
of the Torriente, a bubbling hill stream with banks of
blue and white periwinkle and a masonry bed overhung
with thousands of orange and lemon trees, beneath which
lie oranges in golden mounds, like cider apples in a
Somerset orchard. In spite of the scale disease, which
in latter years has wrought havoc in many groves—blackening
the fruit and destroying the foliage—the
oranges of Sollér are still famous, and fetch market
prices ranging from a penny to fivepence a dozen, according
to quality, while a dozen of the best lemons are here
sold for twopence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The streets of Fornalutx are principally flights of broad
cobbled steps, and many of the houses are extremely
ancient and fascinating, with quaint wooden balustrades,
carved window frames, and old stone archways. One of
those we visited had an oil mill on the premises, and we
were shown the stone bins into which the panniers of
olives are first emptied, and the great trough in which
they are subsequently crushed with a millstone turned
by a mule; the olive pulp is then placed in flat, circular
baskets, and when these are piled up in layers to a considerable
height, boiling water is poured over them and
they are crushed flat by an immense baulk of timber that
descends upon them from above. The exuding liquid
flows into a tank below, where by the happy provision
of Nature the oil is able to be drawn off by a surface pipe
while the water is carried away by one at the bottom.
The olive harvest takes place in October and November;
the oil is much used in Majorcan cookery—though not to
any unpleasant extent—and children are often seen
eating slices of bread spread with oil in place of the jam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>or dripping with which it would be flavoured in our own
country.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Our stay at Sollér was cut short by the unkindness of
the weather. For two days the rain held off, grudgingly;
but on the third we awoke to find the whole valley
enveloped in a dense Scotch mist; our host looked up at
the blurred outlines of the mountains, and he looked at
the gusts of cloud that were blowing through the <i>barranco</i>,
and he shook his head; he was honest, and he confessed
that the prospect was not hopeful. A rain wind sobbed
round the house as we sat over the wood fire that evening,
and from an adjoining room came the singularly
monotonous chant—high, nasal, and quavering—with
which a Majorcan servant girl can accompany her sweeping
for hours at a time. The effect was indescribably
triste, and our thoughts turned to the flesh pots of
Palma.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following morning showed no improvement, so
our host’s victoria was requisitioned and we set out
on our return to the Grand Hotel. For an hour and a
half our two sturdy horses toiled up out of the valley, the
winding zigzags of the road affording us now and again a
backward glance at the little white town lying in the lap
of the hills, framed by converging mountain slopes. On
reaching the top of the pass we met a fresher air, and we
rattled merrily down the beautifully graded road towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the plain, drawing up presently at the wayside villa of
Alfádia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alfádia is an ancient caravanserai that still bears traces
of its Moorish origin; passing under the high entrance
gateway, which has a Moorish ceiling of carved and
painted wood, one enters a vast courtyard, surrounded by
stables and containing a fountain and a pepper-tree of
immense size and age. When first we entered the great
quadrangle it was absolutely deserted, but no sooner did
our camera mount its tripod than with the mysterious
suddenness of Roderick Dhu’s men figures emerged from
all sides, anxious to be included in the picture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardly had we regained our carriage when the rain
that had long been threatening began to come down—first
gently, then harder, and finally with a terrific clap
of thunder we were overtaken by a kind of cloudburst.
Whipping up the horses our driver made a dash for a
wayside inn on the Palma road, and driving in under the
deep verandah-like porch running along the whole front
of the building we drew up and were gradually joined by
other refugees till every inch of standing room was taken
up. Cheek by jowl with us were white-tilted orange
carts from Sollér, a countryman and his cow, a post cart,
sundry mules, and a number of pedestrians who arrived
half drowned beneath their umbrellas; and in this most
welcome shelter we all remained imprisoned while for the
next half hour it rained as I have never seen it rain before.
Cascades fell from the edge of the verandah roof, the road
became a river, and from the olive grounds gory floods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>were descending and were struggling and leaping through
the culverts like the legions of red rats charmed out of
Hamelin by the pied piper.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is with diffidence that I venture to observe that a
<em>very unusual</em> amount of rain fell around Palma this
spring—for there is a growing feeling of incredulity on
the subject of unusual seasons. I have heard of a man
who had lived for thirty years in Algiers, and who asserted
that in that time he had experienced thirty unusual
seasons. Few winter resorts perhaps could equal this
record, but I fancy that in most places abnormal seasons
of one kind or another are sufficiently common for the
really normal one—when it does make its appearance—to
be almost, if not quite, as unusual as the rest.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On April 16th we took the train for Alcúdia and
set out on our fourth and final tour in Majorca.
When I say that we took the train for Alcúdia I mean
that we went as far in that direction as the train would
carry us, for with a strange perversity the railway line,
instead of running right across the island from Palma to
Alcúdia and so connecting the latter and its Minorcan
service of boats with the rest of the world, stops short
some ten miles from the coast, perhaps with a view to
annoying possible invaders.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Two hours after leaving Palma we descended at the
terminus of La Puébla, where we and five other persons
scrambled with difficulty into an immensely high two-wheeled
carrier’s cart covered with a canvas tilt. For
an hour and a half the stout horse jogged slowly along a
flat road, and then we drove under the great fortified
gateway of San Sebastian and entered Alcúdia, an ancient
town of dingy-looking houses, with paved alleys so narrow
that our horse had to put his head right in at people’s
front doors in order to turn the sharp street corners.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alcúdia is still surrounded by strong walls and a moat,
fortifications dating partly from Roman and partly from
Moorish days. During the great peasant revolt of the
sixteenth century the Aragonese nobles came here for
refuge; their yoke had been a heavy one, and since the
annexation of the island by the crown of Aragon discontent
and unrest had filled the population. Oppressed and
heavily taxed, they at last rose in insurrection, and forming
themselves into armed bands laid siege to Alcúdia till
the arrival of a Spanish fleet turned the scales against
them. Their leader, Colom, was beheaded, and his head
sent to Palma, where for more than two hundred years it
hung in an iron cage at the <i>Puerta Margarita</i>, near to
which is a square that still bears his name.</p>

<p class='c013'>We did not stop in Alcúdia, but passing out of the
town by the fine Roman gate called the <i>Puerta del Muelle</i>
we drove on to the harbour, about a mile distant.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Fonda de la Marina</i> on the seashore is a large and
quite civilised inn, with whitewashed corridors and rows
of numbered deal doors; it is a very marine <i>fonda</i> indeed,
being situated actually on the water’s edge, so that our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>driver before putting us down takes a short turn in the
sea to wash his cart wheels. Fishing-smacks lie under
our windows, and Francisca the general servant—in
whose absence everything is at a standstill and who is
being perpetually screeched for from the front door—comes
up hurriedly in a small boat from the mole where
she has been buying fish for our dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our host informed us that two visitors were already
installed in the house, but when we inquired their
names and nationality he was hopelessly vague. To the
Majorcan innkeeper foreigners are foreigners, and as
such will naturally know all other foreigners; and he
describes bygone guests by their appearance, age, and
such traits as he has observed in them, confident that
they will be at once recognised by the person to whom
he speaks. To his disappointment, however, we entirely
failed—in spite of his most graphic description—to
identify our fellow guests, and it was not till we were
sitting at table that evening, over our raisins and
cabbages, our lobster salad and cutlets, that we saw two
strangers enter whom we perceived to be English. They
told us they had been here more than a week, and had
thoroughly enjoyed their stay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very peaceful is the great bay of Alcúdia, with its
sand dunes and pine woods, its reedy marshes, and its
sickle-curve of dazzling white sand encircling the deep
blue water. One may wander for miles along the lonely
shore, watching the ways of the burying-beetles that
live in large colonies among the bee orchises and cistus
bushes above high-water mark, or searching for shells
and fragments of coral among the seaweed rissoles of the
<i>Poseidonia oceanica</i> that bestrew the beach in countless
numbers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>There are many excursions in the neighbourhood that
good walkers can easily accomplish on foot. Between
the harbour and the town of Alcúdia are the remains of
a Roman amphitheatre, supposed to mark the site of the
old Pollentia—long disappeared; on a rocky slope, converted
into a wild flower garden by a gorgeous tangle of
yellow daisies, convolvulus, borage, asphodel and mallow,
can be traced partial tiers of seats and flights of steps
cut in the rock; and in a depression of the ground are
seen the caves originally destined for wild beasts, but
now inhabited by nothing more ferocious than a family
of black pigs couched upon a bed of seaweed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here and there among the flowers one stumbles into a
grave; there are rows upon rows of these Roman graves—narrow,
shallow tombs cut in the surface of the rock
and half filled with earth. Fragments of Roman pottery,
broken lamps, skulls and bones are constantly picked up,
and two years ago a grave was found intact by some men
who were quarrying freestone. Like the rest, it was
quite shallow, and in it was found a quantity of gold
jewellery that had evidently belonged to a Roman lady.
We were shown the ornaments, which comprised a brooch
set with rubies, an oval locket—which at one time had
apparently contained a portrait—a long chain necklace
with clasps, set with small pearls and two emeralds; two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>handsome gold and pearl earrings, and a few smaller
trinkets. In another tomb was found a gold bracelet,
and a silver coin said to be of the reign of Tiberius. All
these are now in the possession of the finder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Close to the Roman cemetery are some other graves,
half hidden by rough grass. As our guide turned over
the earth with his foot he disclosed a jawbone furnished
with a row of splendid molars; from the style of burial
and other indications these graves have been decided to
be Moorish, but as far as we could learn no systematic
investigation of the ground has yet been attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following morning we drove to the <i>Castillo de
Moros</i>, in one of the usual tilted carts, drawn by a big
mule that for some time showed no sign of being able to
go at any pace but a walk; our remark, however, that a
horse would have been swifter, put the driver on his
mettle, and, declaring that his mule had great velocity,
he urged the animal into a fast trot which was kept up
as long as the condition of the road rendered it in any
degree possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Skirting the town by an arrow track cut in the bedrock,
and dating probably from Roman times, we struck
out across country to the Moorish fort that stands on a
promontory overlooking the bay of Pollensa. In spite
of its age the little <i>Castillo</i> is in good preservation;
moat and bastions are almost intact, and a squat pylon
of yellow freestone gives entrance to the building and to
a broad, flagged terrace on the side towards the sea.
Goats browse around the ramparts among palmetto and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>lentisk, cactus and asphodel; and framed in the embrasures
of the masonry is the gorgeous blue of the bay,
with the long serrated ranges of Cap Formentór visible
in the far distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Below us, silhouetted against the distant headland of
the Cap de Pinár, stood one of the <i>nórias</i>, or Persian
wheels, introduced by the Moors and still used in the
island for raising water from wells. Bushes of pink
stock clambered into the ancient stone aqueduct, which
led away from the nória across the bean fields; some
sheep were grazing the stony ground, watched by a boy
in an enormous straw hat, who stood in the shade of a
clump of pines. It was a pretty pastoral scene, typical
of the peaceful tide of life that flows on around the
Moors’ old fort.</p>

<p class='c013'>The southern shore of the Bay of Pollensa is very
beautiful, and by an amazingly bad road it is possible to
drive a considerable way along it, to the Cap de Pinar, a
wild headland where we spent a delightful hour; at our
feet—far, far below—lay the waters of the bay, and
beyond it the trackless sierra of Cap Formentór stretches
its arm northwards till it ends in a bold cliff that plunges
sheer into the sea. Behind us is a mountain range, on
the slopes of which is visible the pilgrimage church of
Our Lady of Victory, and looking inland we can see the
pale blue pyramid of the Puig Mayór.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a <i>fête</i> day, and crowds of holiday makers were
returning from the Cap—whole family parties laden with
palmetto roots slung over their shoulders; the heart of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>this dwarf palm is considered a delicacy by the Majorcans;
the plant is chopped out of the ground with an axe, and
the lower leaves trimmed off close, leaving only a tuft of
young shoots at the top, which gives the root an almost
precise resemblance to a pineapple. But it is a woody
form of nourishment, and not a taste to be acquired after
childhood I should imagine.</p>

<p class='c013'>On April 18th we left Alcúdia for Pollensa. A gale had
arisen in the night, and we awoke to find the bay flecked
with foam caps and the white sand flying like smoke
along the shore. The Barcelona boat was many hours
overdue, and the fishing fleet could not put out to sea, so
that the men, who had stocked their boats overnight with
kegs of water and provisions, instead of being off at daybreak
as was their wont, were reduced to mending their
nets and splitting firewood while they waited, with all the
philosophic patience of their kind, for the wind to abate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pollensa is about an hour and a half’s drive from
Alcúdia. Surrounded by ancient olive groves and
rockeries planted with patches of beans and wheat, the
old town lies secluded among the hills, out of sight and
out of sound of the sea—only three miles distant. On
one side of the town rises the green Calvary hill, on the
other the bare grey <i>Puig de Pollensa</i>, crowned by a
pilgrimage church and <i>hospedéria</i>; this passion for building
a church on the highest and most inaccessible spot
attainable is a really curious phenomenon.</p>

 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>An atmosphere of old-world tranquillity pervades the
place; undisturbed by railways, approached by only one
good road—that from La Puebla—and brought in touch
hardly at all with the outside world, Pollensa is the most
characteristically Majorcan town in the whole island.
The older men still wear the wide Moorish breeches, the
woollen stockings and strong leather shoes latched across
with a bow, which the younger ones have forsaken in
favour of the less picturesque modern garb. The generation
now dying out is the last that will be seen in the
dress worn by their forefathers for a thousand years past,
and I am glad to have visited the island before the
costume has become a mere tradition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Castillian is little spoken in Pollensa, and our stay at
the inn of Antonio de Sollér was complicated by the fact
that our good host and his daughter knew rather less
Spanish than we did ourselves. The old woman who
swept the floors was, I think, a little touched in the head,
and she annoyed us considerably for some time by pausing
in front of us with uplifted broom—as we sat in our
rocking chairs, peacefully reading—and haranguing us in
Majorcan, of which she knew we did not understand a
word.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Les silents ont toujours tort</i>”—and at last we turned
the tables on her by suddenly bursting forth in emphatic
English, which had the effect of silencing her completely,
and she departed, muttering darkly, no doubt more convinced
than ever that we were mad.</p>

<p class='c013'>We found our inn to be comfortable, and, in spite of
being in the middle of the town, exceedingly quiet. The
Majorcan cookery is always good, and though liable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>become monotonous, a certain variety of diet is obtained
by moving from place to place. Chicken stewed with
rice, or a ragout, supplemented by fish and an omelette,
form the staple dishes of Majorcan <i>fondas</i>; and each inn
has its own idea of what a sweet course should be, to
which it rigorously adheres; at Felanitx we got into a
stratum of enormous jam puffs—larger than I could have
conceived possible; at Arta it was figs, stuffed with
aniseed; at Alcúdia, slabs of quince jelly; at Pollensa
heavy pastry starfish, which made their appearance twice
a day with unfailing regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>For breakfast coffee can always be obtained—although
it must be remembered that coffee does not necessarily
imply milk, unless specially ordered; and with the coffee
it is the custom to eat an <i>ensaimáda</i>—a kind of sweet
sugar-besprinkled bun. Except at Palma and Sollér,
butter is not to be had; we usually supplied its place with
jam we carried with us, but at Pollensa we found ourselves
reduced to our last pot, and that pot we decided to
save up as emergency rations, for rumour had it that
at Lluch, whither we were bound, we might be glad of
anything at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The morning after our arrival at Pollensa we drove out
to the <i>Cala de San Vicente</i>, a bay on the north coast
of the island; after driving over a bad road for some miles
we left the <i>galaréta</i> and walked down to the sea by
a charming path leading through pine woods and a wild
rock-garden of pink and white cistus and yellow broom,
where for the first time we heard the nightingale. Near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the shore are large freestone quarries—smooth-walled
pits of cream-coloured stone—where men are employed
in detaching great blocks with wedges, and shaping them
with saw and axe; so plentiful is the freestone in many
parts of the island that not only the houses, but the field-walls
and even the pigstyes are built of it. It is extremely
soft and easy to work when first quarried, and has the
invaluable property of hardening more and more as time
goes on, when exposed to the air. This causes many of
the ancient buildings—such as the Lonja and others—to
look quite disappointingly modern, owing to the smooth,
unweathered surface of the walls and the sharp lines
of all angles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Exceedingly picturesque is the little blue bay of St.
Vincent, with its enclosing cliff walls and jagged peaks;
on a small headland stands a ruined <i>ataláya</i> of curious
construction, the tower being rounded on the land side,
but forming an acute angle towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Amongst the prickly pear and boulders of this headland
we noticed a large, almost circular, block of stone that
attracted our attention from its bearing traces of a rude
square cut in its upper surface. We asked the daughter of
our <i>fondista</i>, who was with us, whether there was any legend
attaching to the ancient stone, but she was interested not
at all in pre-historic man:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That <i>mésa</i>,” she explained—<i>mésa</i> means table, and
is the term applied to all the megalithic altars in the
Balearics—“that <i>mésa</i> is there for visitors to have their
luncheon upon.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>This lack of observation and of intelligent interest in
their surroundings we found not uncommon among the
people, who have an almost Oriental incuriosity with
regard to things that do not practically concern them.
Many a time did we draw the attention of a native to
some conspicuous plant growing in profusion around his
home, and ask him what kind of flower it bore when
in bloom; whereupon he would reply without hesitation
that that particular plant never flowered at all, and
consider himself well out of the matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember being told by a traveller in Spain that once
when in the very centre of the liquorice industry he
inquired of his landlord what part of the plant was used,
to which he replied that it was the root:</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what kind of plant is it that supplies these roots?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, there is no plant at all—nothing to be seen above
ground.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Pursuing his inquiries further, he found a man who
admitted that there was certainly a plant, but he maintained
that it never flowered. This was in the neighbourhood
of acres of the plant, then in full flower!</p>

<p class='c013'>In the afternoon our host drove us to Aubercuix in
a tilted cart, with an old flea-bitten Rosinante in the
shafts. Passing the quaint <i>Fuente de Gallo</i>—an urn-shaped
stone fountain presided over by a spruce cock,
where all day long the women fill their water jars—we had
not proceeded more than half a mile on our way when the
back bench of our conveyance, on which we both were
sitting, broke down with a loud crack, and in the confusion
our best umbrella fell out in front and got badly
kicked by the horse. Our host was aghast; he jumped
down and repaired the damage as quickly as possible—propped
up the seat with some chunks of firewood that
happened to be in the cart—disengaged the umbrella from
the horse’s hind leg—and tried to assure us that all was
well. But it was far from well. Our appearance had for
some time past not been our strong point; repeated
wettings and dryings had not improved our hats; our
clothes were almost worn out—and now the best umbrella
was just as baggy and bent and stained as the other, and,
moreover, would only open in a lop-sided way.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>We were not a little annoyed at this mishap, but our
annoyance was soon quenched in amusement, so curiously
unconventional was our host’s style of driving; hollerin’
and bellerin’ like Prince Giglio of immortal fame, as
though driving half a dozen plough teams at once, our
good host urged the old horse to speed with a running
accompaniment of vituperation and ceaseless objurgations,
ranging from threats to cajolements, thence to sarcasm,
and occasionally rising to heights of scathing laughter,
which startled the old horse more than anything else. It
must not be imagined, however, that our progress was
rapid; the noise served to clear the road for half a mile
ahead of us, it is true, but the old horse had to be allowed
to walk down every descent, while on the flat he was not
expected to exceed a gentle trot; he understood his master
perfectly, and feared him not at all. Never did we see
an animal ill-treated in Majorca.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The road to Aubercuix takes one down to the port of
Pollensa, and thence round the bay as far as the little
lighthouse on the opposite point; beyond this one can
only penetrate into the <i>Cap de Formentór</i> by a bad mule
track, or by taking a sailing boat and landing in some
little cove along the coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wonderful was the view, glorified by the golden evening
light, that we obtained as we wound along the water’s
edge and followed the gravelled causeway leading to the
<i>Fáro</i>; across the bay shone the white town of Alcúdia,
seemingly built on the seashore, though in reality far
inland; looking back towards Pollensa the scene was of
marvellous beauty—in the foreground the curve of the
shore, broken by black clumps of rushes, a few stunted
trees, and an upturned boat lying on the sand; beyond,
some fishermen’s huts, with here and there a dark pine-tree,
sharp-cut against the dim distance of the sierra.
Rank behind rank, their planes parted by the evening
mist, veiled in shimmering tints of pink and violet, dove
colour and indigo, and melting away into the sunset sky
itself, stretched the mountain chains behind Pollensa.
Their peaks were tinged with flame, and the rays of the
setting sun descended like fire-escapes of golden web into
the azure mist that filled the valleys.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a few minutes the unearthly light lingered, and
then the sun sank out of sight; a chill sea-breeze sprang
up as we set our faces homeward, and the stars were
shining serenely before we regained our <i>fonda</i>.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The following morning we rode to the <i>Castillo del Rey</i>,
the route taking us, soon after starting, over the fine old
Roman bridge at the entrance of the town. For an hour
and a half we pursued a good mule-track up the gorge of
the Ternallas, a mountain stream dashing down through
woods of ilex and pine, with bare grey peaks towering
overhead; leaving the forest we came out into a grassy
and boulder-strewn trough among the hills, and presently
arrived at the foot of the crag on which the castle stands.
So inaccessible does the rock look, crowned by the
skeleton ribs of the old banqueting hall—yellow rock and
yellow masonry welded in one—that at first sight one
wonders how the ascent is to be even attempted. Up a
steep hillside, covered with rocks, loose stones, and prickly
shrubs, we scrambled and toiled on foot for nearly half an
hour; more and more desperate grew the path as we
advanced, larger and larger the rocks to be surmounted;
but at last, with a final effort, we scaled a boulder over
six feet in height and were hauled up by our muleteers
into the arched doorway of the old fortress.</p>

<p class='c013'>The origin of the castle is lost in the mists of antiquity;
it is supposed to have existed in the time of the Romans,
and under the Moors it formed an important stronghold
to which they retreated after evacuating Palma. Later
on the flag of Jaime III. still waved over the <i>Castillo del
Rey</i> after the whole of the rest of the island had gone
over to Pedro of Aragon, but in the year 1343 the loyal
garrison was forced to surrender after a siege of more
than two months.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Not much of the fortress survives at the present time;
three pointed freestone arches belonging to the central
hall form the most conspicuous feature of the ruins.
Beyond this there is little except some subterranean
chambers, and a few fragments of rock-like wall and
pointed battlement, still untouched by time, that survive
amidst a chaos of masonry. From the northern edge of
the cliff—an appalling precipice descending sheer to the
sea—a magnificent view over the coast and the surrounding
mountains is to be had on a clear day, but on the
occasion of our own visit ominous stormclouds were
closing in around us, and the horizon was a blank pall of
rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardly had we sat down to luncheon when heavy drops
began to fall; seizing our cutlets and oranges we fled to
the rock tunnel leading from the entrance to the interior
of the castle, and in that narrow and draughty passage
continued our interrupted meal; but to our dismay
rivulets soon began to invade our retreat, the heavens
poured down water through a machicolation overhead,
and before long we were sitting, like the Blessed Catalina,
on stones in the middle of a river bed, while a growing
torrent flowed beneath our feet. Our men wrapped their
blankets around them and squatted patiently in the doorway.
Presently footsteps were heard, and a wet stranger
scrambled breathlessly in at the tunnel’s mouth, accompanied
by a guide in wide indigo breeches soaked to the
consistency of jelly bags, while rivulets ran from the brim
of his felt hat.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Still it poured—steadily—without intermission; the
landscape below us was blotted out by a veil of driving
rain; banks of cloud were sweeping in from the sea and
settling in woolly folds upon the hills, which appeared
and disappeared as one storm after another broke over
them and passed on. For two hours we waited, and
then there came a lull; sallying out in desperation we
slid and scrambled down the slippery rocks and soaking
vegetation of the steep hillside, and rejoining our equally
wet mules set out for home. The red path was now a
quagmire under foot, and the little watercourses were
leaping and chasing down the hills to join the river; but
the rain held off and we got back in safety, being met at
the inn door by a chorus of inquiries as to how we had
fared, laments over our wetting, and an optimistic assurance
that on the morrow the weather would be very <i>bonito</i>
indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But when morning dawned it was far from being <i>bonito</i>—it
could hardly look worse. Nevertheless we determined
on making the march to Lluch—a ride of about four hours
across the mountains. The charge for a mule with its
attendant muleteer is six pesetas for this journey if they
return the same day; but if, as in our case, they are
retained at Lluch for further expeditions, an additional
five pesetas is asked for the return trip to Pollensa. One
of our mules was a very smart-looking beast, ridden with
the iron noseband which in Majorca usually takes the
place of a bit, and carrying the English side-saddle we
had brought with us, covered with a sheepskin to lessen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the slipperiness so fatiguing to the rider when going up or
down a steep mountain path for hours at a time. The
other one was a sturdy pack animal, bridled in inferior
manner with a hemp halter and furnished with pack
saddle and panniers.</p>

<p class='c013'>These pack saddles are extremely comfortable to ride
on if they are well balanced; one sits as on a broad, soft
platform between the panniers, dangling a foot on either
side of the mule’s neck, the idea being that if the beast
falls you will alight on your feet and get clear of him
whichever way he rolls. As a matter of fact you find
it impossible to move at all, partly owing to the adhesive
nature of the sheepskin on which you are seated, and
partly to a heterogeneous mass of luggage—rugs, valises,
and fodder bags—piled high on either hand, while
umbrellas and tripod-legs close your last avenue of
escape.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mounting of a laden pack-saddle is a problem in
itself, and to the last I could discover no system upon
which the feat is accomplished; a wild, spasmodic leap,
taken from some wall near the animal, usually—but not
always—lands one in the saddle, and once in position a
fatalistic calm is the best attitude with which to confront
the perils of the ensuing ride. The most well-meaning
of mules has habits which do not conduce to the happiness
of his rider upon a mountain track; he will pause on a
hogsback ridge of slippery cobbles in the middle of a
swift stream, to gaze entranced, with pricked ears, at
the distant landscape; with an absolutely expressionless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>countenance he carries one under a low bough—or
anchors himself in front by fixing his teeth firmly in a
tough shrub as he strides by, and then falls over himself
as his stern overtakes him. In short he awakens in his
rider a lively sympathy with Dr. Johnson, who was
carried as uncontrollably on a horse as in a balloon.</p>

<p class='c013'>The paths were in an unusually bad state that day
owing to the recent heavy rain; great parts of the track
were under water; every torrent was swelled to twice its
normal size, and miniature Lauterbrunnen falls were
leaping down the faces of the cliffs. We forded several
streams, slithered down causeways of loose sliding
blocks, and scrambled up slippery rock steps where it
was all the mules could do to keep their feet and avoid
falling backwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first hour we rode in drenching rain through
dark ilex woods and fine mountain scenery; but as we
got higher the weather improved—the sun came out, the
birds began to sing, the scent of wet cistus bushes filled
the air, and emerging on to a grassy plateau we presently
came in sight of the monastery of Lluch, lying in a level
valley high up among the hills—a great pile of yellow
buildings backed by grey rocks and ilex-trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>Crossing the wide green, with its long range of stabling,
its poplar-trees and fountain, we dismount—wet and tired—under
the entrance archway, and pass into a large quadrangle
formed by the college, the <i>hospedéria</i>, the priests’
house, and the oratory, an ornate chapel hung with embroidered
banners presented to Our Lady of Lluch.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The history of this oratory goes back to a date shortly
after the conquest in the thirteenth century, when a
herd-boy named Lluch—or Lucas—while driving his
flock home one night, noticed a strange light upon the
mountain side; on relating this to a priest, the latter
went to examine the spot whence the light proceeded,
and there discovered a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin
and Child, which was installed forthwith in a little
chapel built for the purpose; and this Virgin of Lluch—the
<i>Máre de Deu</i> as she is called—became in course of
time the patroness of the Majorcans, and a great power
in the land. Bequests of money and land were made to
her, and in the fifteenth century the Oratory was founded,
together with a college for the instruction of twelve
poor children. The original college now forms the
<i>hospedéria</i> for visitors, having been superseded by a
newer building where to this day twelve boys receive
education and instruction in church singing from the
four priests who inhabit the <i>rectoria</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wants of visitors are attended to by six lay brothers,
and at times the resources of the establishment are
strained to their utmost. We were told that at Easter
no fewer than six hundred people had made the pilgrimage
hither, coming from all parts of the island and staying
two or even three nights; those for whom there was no
room in the <i>hospedéria</i> were bedded in the corridors and
stables, while the rest slept in their carts and carriages
outside.</p>

<p class='c013'>Until recently all comers had to bring their own food,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>but some few years ago a kind of restaurant—independent
of the monastery—was established, where visitors can
get simple meals at a very moderate charge. The wife
of the <i>fondista</i> cooks well, and though neither meat,
milk, nor butter are to be had, the staple provisions of
sausage, sardines, cheese, bread, coffee, and condensed
milk—with the addition of a fowl or an omelette—constitute
a diet with which any traveller may be content.
After supper one crosses the great quadrangle to the
<i>hospedéria</i>, which contains some fifty beds, placed two,
three, and even four in a room.</p>

<p class='c013'>In answer to the bell at the iron grille a lay brother
made his appearance and took us upstairs and down a
long, spacious, echoing corridor to one of the whitewashed
cells, where he presented us with a key and a pair of
damp sheets and left us to our own devices. The room
was sparsely furnished, and contained two beds, with a
pile of mattresses and blankets, a small table, a chair,
a diminutive tripod supporting a basin, an equally
diminutive towel, and an earthenware jar with some
water.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment it did not strike us that we were
expected to make our own beds, and after waiting some
time we sent an urgent message to our friar by a young
man we met on the stairs and who seemed faintly
amused at the errand. No one came, however—and
neither on that nor on any subsequent occasion did Brother
Bartholomew condescend to attend to us in any way
whatever, or even supply us with more water, so that on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the second morning we were reduced to a kind of <i>nettoyage
à sec</i>. The only thing he did for us was to come and
rattle our door loudly at five o’clock in the morning to
make us get up—and failing in his attempt, to go away,
having either by accident or with malice aforethought
turned the key in the door and locked us in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not till breakfast time that we discovered our
plight, and we should have been constrained ignominiously
to call for help from the window had we not succeeded in
picking the lock with a buttonhook and so regained our
freedom.</p>

<p class='c013'>At nine o’clock we set out on our mules for the <i>Gorch
Blau</i>, a two hours’ ride from the monastery. It is hopeless
to ascertain beforehand from one’s muleteers the
nature of the road that lies before one, for they admit
no difference between one mountain path and another,
and assure one invariably that the road will be good the
whole way; nor are they in any way abashed when
presently you come to a slippery rock staircase, so impossible
that they advise you—in your own interest—to
dismount and proceed on foot. The ride to the Gorge
includes, as far as I can remember, only one really
<i>mauvais quart d’heure</i>—but the rain had converted the
paths into sloughs, and our poor men soon had their
shoes soaked through and through, in spite of making
<i>détours</i> wherever possible to avoid the floods through
which our mules splashed recklessly.</p>

<p class='c013'>But if all this water increased the difficulties of the
march it also added immensely to the beauty of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>landscape. As we wound along the heights we could
hear the <i>Torrent de Pareys</i> in its deep cañon bed,
thundering down in flood to the sea, and we found the
<i>Gorch Blau</i> filled with a rushing whirl of foaming
emerald-green water instead of containing—as it often
does—a supply so scanty as hardly to deserve the name
of torrent at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towering fern-clad cliffs close in upon a ravine a few
yards only in width, through which the water dashes at
racing speed with a noise that prevents one from hearing
oneself speak. An ancient pack-bridge spans the stream,
and a path cut in the side of the water-worn cliff leads
through the gorge into a broad open valley—a valley of
desolation, ringed round with walls of bare grey rock,
and strewn with innumerable stones, amongst which
sheep and goats pick up a scanty living. For another
hour we followed the course of the stream, now flowing
tranquilly over a pebbly bed, and then reached a spot
known as the <i>Pla de Cuba</i>—a higher valley among the
hills, through which runs the path to Sollér, five hours
distant. Here we made a two hours’ halt, and while the
mules ate carob beans and cropped the coarse <i>carritx</i>
grass covering the hillside, we explored the rocky slopes
in search of the pink orchises and white cyclamen that
grow here in profusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>These high regions have a far larger annual rainfall
than the rest of the island, and the comparative dampness
of the atmosphere is seen in the mossy trunks and
fern-clad limbs of the ilex woods, as also in the unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>girth of the trees—one grand old ilex, said to be the
largest tree in Majorca, having a diameter of fully eight
feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Clouds gather every evening upon the mountain tops
around Lluch, and the plateau itself, sixteen hundred
feet above sea-level, is often shrouded in fog for days
together. In bad weather a stay at the monastery is by
no means enjoyable, and when we woke on the second
morning and found the rain falling fast, we were not
sorry to think that the <i>galaréta</i> we had ordered from
Inca to fetch us would arrive in an hour or so. Our
shoes and skirts had never dried thoroughly since the
soaking they got on our ride from Pollensa, and the
unwarmed rooms felt miserably chilly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Going across to the restaurant, where we breakfasted
at an icy marble-topped table, we found four young
Frenchmen, who had arrived overnight, stamping their
feet on the cold stone floor and bitterly bewailing their
fate; they had come with the sole object of seeing the
Gorch Blau—and now, not only was the expedition out
of the question, but they were imprisoned in this dismal
place—for <i>voila!</i> by this frightful weather it was impossible
even to depart. What to do! <i>Mon Dieu! Mon
Dieu!</i></p>

<p class='c013'>We could offer little comfort beyond suggesting that
some misguided visitor might turn up during the morning,
in whose conveyance they could make their escape—a
contingency which both they and we felt to be very
unlikely ... but even as we spoke, we saw to our
surprise <em>two</em> empty carriages cross the green and draw
up before the monastery.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Two blacks may not make a white—but two mistakes
may result in a remarkably good arrangement. Owing
to a misunderstanding with our late host of Pollensa—who,
it must be remembered, spoke nothing but Majorcan—a
<i>galaréta</i> had been sent up from La Puebla for us,
besides the one which we ourselves had ordered from
Inca. Behold, then, a solution of the difficulty! We
stowed ourselves into one carriage—our four enchanted
fellow-visitors into the other—and away we bowled
towards Inca, a two hours’ drive on a splendid road
engineered in giddy spirals down the mountain side, with
ever and again a peep of the plain and its white town far
below us, seen through a break in the hills.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we get down into the zone of olives again, a
warmer air meets us—the rain has been left behind, and
we are once more in sunshine; passing the picturesque
village of Selva, with its church perched on the very top
of a hill, we soon find ourselves at Inca—a large and
prosperous-looking town of fine stone houses and shops.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here we took the train for Palma, and packed ourselves
and our valises into a little first-class compartment
which we shared with an aristocratic-looking old gentleman
travelling with a large wicker basket, apparently
containing the week’s wash, and with a lady in a graceful
black mantilla, who had a market basket, and a big
bundle done up in a check tablecloth. She was evidently
leaving home for a few days, and many and anxious were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the parting messages given to the two honest servant-girls
who stood at the carriage window and with a hearty embrace
bade their mistress goodbye before the train started.</p>

<p class='c013'>The terms upon which master and servant meet in
Majorca—and I fancy all over Spain—are very much
freer than with us.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Palma at the end of April is a very different town from
the Palma of a few weeks ago; the trees along the Borne
are greening fast, and the country is a mass of leafage.
The swifts have arrived, and are wheeling and screaming
over the town in thousands; the masses of dwarf blue
iris by the seashore are over, but the waist-high corn is
spangled with poppies and corn daisies, gladioli, and a
handsome crimson and yellow scrophularia. The roads
are deep in dust—the river dry as a bone. Our rooms
maintain a steady temperature of 66° Fahrenheit, and
the heat in the middle of the day is already sufficient to
make us appreciate the draughtiness of the cool, narrow
streets of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>Palm Sunday is celebrated by a palm service in the
cathedral, and by a palm fair—the <i>Fiesta de Rámos</i>. At
the palm service the bishop, mitred and coped, and
accompanied by priests, choristers, mace-bearers, and all
the dignitaries of the cathedral, processes around the
outside of the building—and all carry consecrated palm
branches in their hands. These palms are afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>distributed amongst the townspeople, who fasten them
to their house-fronts and balconies as a protection
against lightning.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Fiesta de Rámos</i> takes place in the Rambla, where
for three days the wide gravelled walk is occupied by a
double row of wooden booths, between which a seething
throng of townspeople streams up and down; there are
toys and sweets and fruit stalls—dolls and dolls’ furniture,
and charming baskets of all sizes, down to the familiar
covered market basket made in smallest miniature by the
neatest of fingers; there are merry-go-rounds and a
Japanese giant, drums, trumpets, and squeaking whistles,
and for three days there is a pandemonium of noisy
instruments which to the children is the seventh heaven
of delight.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the spring, too, the annual swearing-in of the new
recruits takes place, and is a picturesque sight; all the
troops in the town—cavalry, infantry, and artillery—are
assembled on the great Plaza Santa Catalina outside the
walls, where is erected a large red and yellow marquee
surmounted by a royal crown and flanked by cannon,
stacked rifles, and warlike trophies of swords and
bayonets. Inside the tent is an altar with lighted
candles, and when all the high civil and military
officials of the town have arrived, mass is celebrated—the
elevation of the Host being marked by three shrill
bugle calls, at which the whole body of troops and
spectators fall on one knee and uncover—the cavalry
lowering their swords.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>After this, a priest walks round the lines, and halting
opposite each regiment reads a short address, at the close
of which a simultaneous assent bursts forth from the
ranks of the new conscripts. When all have been sworn
in, the recruits—who on this occasion numbered three or
four hundred—defile in front of the colours, kissing the
flag and uncovering as they go by.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with this the ceremony is over for the year.</p>

  <h2 id='ch3' class='c004'>PART III<br /> <br /><span class='large'>IVIZA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c012'>The small steamer that plies three times a week—weather
permitting—between Palma and the
island of Iviza does so wholly in vain as far as foreign
visitors are concerned. I think if the whole annals of
the Grand Hotel were searched they would hardly produce
a single record of a stranger having gone to Iviza,
or, if he did, of having ever come back to tell the tale.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was obvious that the only way of finding out anything
about the island and its inhabitants was to go
there ourselves, and, prompted by curiosity, we one fine
day boarded the noonday boat and set forth on our
voyage of exploration, our only life-line a letter of
introduction to one Sebastian Roig, keeper of the <i>Fonda
de la Marina</i> at Iviza—a letter full of greeting and
amiability, with a civil postscript to the effect that our
blood would be required at his hands if evil befell us
during our stay in the island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Away we went. Once outside the bay the little
<i>Isleño</i> rolled horribly, and we ourselves remained prostrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>below, till at eight o’clock in the evening we felt
the boat come to a standstill and heard the anchor being
let down; whereupon we arose and came on deck,
thinking that the worst was over and that we could now
step on shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bitterly were we disappointed!</p>

<p class='c013'>Neither quay nor shore was in sight, for owing to the
rough sea we had not been able to enter the harbour at
all, but were tossing up and down half a mile from the
pier. It was pitch dark and raining hard. Some fishermen
in glistening oilskins were unloading tunny from a
bobbing, lateen-sailed felucca alongside, and we could
hear the thuds of the stiff, heavy fish being thrown on
board. The dim light of a lantern fell upon a party of
broad-hatted peasants collected on the wet deck, who
one by one were vanishing over the ship’s side and
dropping into a cockleshell of a boat that pranced about
below. Presently it was full, and backing away from
the steamer it disappeared, with a steady splash of oars,
into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such, then, was to be our landing at Iviza! For three-quarters
of an hour we waited, looking out at the slashing
rain and feeling so unutterably miserable that, had it
been possible—even at this eleventh hour—to turn back
to Palma, we should assuredly have turned. But it was
not possible, as the <i>Isleño</i> was bound for Valencia, and
when the boat came back for the third time to fetch us
and one native gentleman—the only passengers left on
board—there was nothing for it but to grope our way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the wet, slippery ladder and from thence to drop either
into the tossing boat, or, as seemed far more probable,
into the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now, in this blackest moment of our whole
journey, appeared a <i>deus ex machina</i> in the shape of the
aforementioned señor; prompted by the kindness of his
heart, and perhaps not unmoved by the sight of two very
forlorn strangers, he took us in charge and reassured us;
there would be no danger at all, he said, if we would
cling firmly to the chain at the foot of the steps and
wait for the boatmen to catch us; he would tell them to
be careful, and as for our valises, a boy would come up
and fetch them when we were safely in the boat. He
helped us down the swaying ladder, and unseen arms
clutched us and dropped us on to a seat, where we sat
down in two large puddles. Our unknown friend jumped
in after us, and the silent oarsmen pulled away from the
black hull looming overhead, and rowed us across the
inky, swirling water to the quay, where a row of
twinkling lights along the harbour’s edge heralded the
town.</p>

<p class='c013'>Landing at a flight of steps, we paid the boatmen
their fee of two and a half pesetas, and then splashed
away in mud and darkness to the inn, where our new
acquaintance left us after promising to look us up on
the morrow. Dinner was going on in the big <i>comedór</i> on
the ground floor—the company consisting of a number
of Ivizan residents and some officers in uniform, with all
of whom we exchanged salutations as we took our seats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>at the long <i>table d’hôte</i>. Never was food more welcome
than that set before us. Half an hour later—wet and
tired, but no longer hungry—we went upstairs, and were
shown into a large red-tiled room, arranged in the Spanish
fashion with two alcoves, shut off by glass doors, containing
each an excellent bed. Unpacking our valises,
we were soon fast asleep, fully prepared to take a more
cheerful view of things on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, alas and alas! when we woke and went to the
window the prospect was as dispiriting as ever. The
<i>fonda</i> stood on the very edge of the water, and we looked
out upon a landlocked port shrouded in fog. It was still
raining, and the leaden sky was merged into a leaden sea
spattered with raindrops. A few seagulls drifted past
the window, uttering melancholy cries, and the only sign
of human life was a solitary old woman who was fishing
patiently from her front doorstep, seated under a large
umbrella.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this juncture a voice at the keyhole announced
breakfast, and going out on to the landing we found tea
and hot buttered toast laid for us on a little table. The
tea possessed in a high degree the primary essential of
good drinking-water—absolute tastelessness; but the
buttered toast was comforting, and as we ate it we
discussed the situation seriously.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Here we were in Iviza, with no possibility of getting
away for the next thirty-six hours, when the <i>Isleño</i> would
call on her return from Valencia. The weather looked
hopeless, but if we were going to allow ourselves to be
influenced by it we should in all probability end by seeing
nothing at all, and our eight hours’ crossing would have
been in vain; our clothes were already so wet that they
need not be taken into account; and after considering
all these points we decided to sally forth and look
about us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardly had we defied the Fates when they relented.
The sky became lighter, the clouds began to clear away,
and as we left our inn a welcome gleam of sunshine
broke out, at sight of which all the ships lying at anchor
in the harbour with one accord spread out their wet
sails to dry.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of the mole a man was fishing in the
shelter of the great breakwater some twenty feet in
height, and thinking that from the summit we might
obtain a good view of the town we asked him if there
was any means of scaling it. Courteously raising his hat,
he replied that the señoras would find no other <i>escalera</i>
than the broken end of the breakwater itself—a nearly
vertical face of stone blocks, each the size of a grand
piano—which he immediately proceeded to climb, carrying
our camera and tripod in one hand. With his help
I also reached the top, from whence a good general view
of the town is obtained, as well as over the bay to where
the pale-grey silhouette of the distant lighthouse divides
sea and sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very picturesque is Iviza, massed high above the
harbour—the lower town, chiefly inhabited by fishing
folk, separated by a sharply marked line of fortification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>from the upper town, the old Jevitzah of the Moors.
Crowning the highest point stands the fortified cathedral,
built almost immediately after the expulsion of the
infidels, and adjoining it is the citadel, enclosing within
its walls the governor’s residence, and barracks for a
hundred men.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the upper town we presently ascended, escorted by
our waiter, who had been sent by our host—mindful,
probably, of the postscript to our letter of introduction—to
attend us. Inquisitive faces appeared at balconies and
doorways as we picked our way through the narrow,
muddy streets of the lower town. Purveyors of drinking
water were going from house to house with donkey-carts
laden with earthenware jars; scores of cats feasted on
remnants of fish in the gutter, and the melancholy Ivizan
hound roamed his native alleys like some canine shade in
search of the happy hunting grounds. Crossing a drawbridge
we pass under the fortified gateway built in the
reign of Philip II.—“Catholic and most invincible king
of Spain and the East and West Indies”—and ascend by
a steep cobbled path to the summit of the town. Many
of the houses are extremely ancient looking, and have
carved lintels and mullions, or the arms of Aragon cut in
stone upon their walls. Passing the prison, where a
bored official was leaning out of the window and yawning
heavily, we entered the courtyard of the citadel—after
giving up our camera to the sentry on guard—and sat
down on a low bastion carpeted with sweet alyssum to
enjoy the panorama around us.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>From this height Formentara and all the lesser rocky
islets that compose the Pityusæ group are clearly discerned
out at sea. The general aspect of Iviza itself is
that of low, wooded hills. Cutting straight across the
island is the long white road leading to St. Antonio on
the western coast, twelve miles distant, and some six miles
to the south of us glisten the great salt works, the famous
<i>salinas</i> of Iviza.</p>

<p class='c013'>To St. Antonio we drove in the afternoon. It was
Holy Week, during which no carriage is allowed to enter
the town, and we had to walk out to the end of the street
where a little <i>carréta</i> awaited us; it was driven by a
comic looking countryman, and drawn by a spirited little
grey horse, a <i>caballo de carréra</i>, one of the racing trotters
for which the islanders have a great partiality. Packed
into this small and fragile conveyance, the driver and
our invaluable waiter in front, ourselves squeezed into
the little side-seats behind, with every symptom of
approaching cramp, we announced ourselves ready to
start.</p>

<p class='c013'>Skirting the town we struck inland along a broad and
splendid road, which for the first few miles is comparatively
flat and then rises to a kind of table-land in the
centre of the island, to fall away again towards the
further coast. The plain is thick with olive groves,
date palms, fig and almond orchards. Snow-white houses
nestle amongst dark clumps of pines—flat-roofed,
oriental-looking houses that resemble great cubes of
chalk, with an arcade of roundheaded arches opening into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>a court on the ground floor, and above this a broad, open
gallery where the inhabitants can sit during the noonday
heat. This windowless form of architecture is a legacy
of the Moors, and the Ivizan peasants are said to have
preserved the characteristics of their Moorish predecessors
to a higher degree than the inhabitants of either
of the sister isles have done. The town-dweller or
fisherman of Iviza—generally of Spanish extraction—is
said to draw a sharp distinction between himself and the
peasants of the interior, whom he looks upon as semi-barbarians.
Their boats are a subject of great merriment
to him, and he makes a point of laughing heartily if he
meets a party of country-folk afloat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At sea,” says the fisherman, “I have no fear of the
peasants—but ashore! they are worse than the Moors!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a character for being turbulent, hot-tempered,
and ill-educated, the Ivizans present a great contrast to
the mild Majorcans. Murders are not infrequent among
them, the almost invariable cause being a quarrel over
cards or the jealousy of rival suitors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor and proud, the peasants look with scant favour on
any member of their community who may have grown
rich and who sets up to be a person of consequence on
that account. “Heaven preserve us,” says the Ivizan,
“from the shoe that has become a boot!” There are no
really wealthy families in the island, and outside the
capital we saw no good houses. The ground is far less
highly cultivated than the Majorcan plains, and Dame
Nature asserts herself in a wealth of wild flowers; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>fields are red with poppies and blue with grape-hyacinths,
and on either side of the road runs a brilliant border composed
of pink tufts of allium swaying on slender stalks,
pale dandelions, dwarf iris, charlock, red dwarf ranunculus,
small yellow cistus and a bright blue borage. As the
road rises we drive through undulating slopes where the
juniper and various conifers grow. The hillsides are
covered with the maritime pine—whence the islands
derived their old name of Pine islands—and large open
stretches of uncultivated ground, intersected by rough
walls of reddish stone, are given up to the great fennel,
seen here for the first time, heath, asphodel, pink and
white cistus, and many other shrubs.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this is very unlike a Majorcan landscape, but still
more striking are the parties of country folk that we meet
upon the road. It is a <i>fête</i> day, and every one is in
<i>grande tenue</i>; whole families are coming to the town or
walking back to their villages—bouquets of bright colour,
purple, blue, yellow, pink, green, and red—quaint figures,
such as one dimly remembers having met with in bygone
days on nursery plates, and having accepted as truthful
representations of that romantic race—the <i>foreign peasant</i>.
Here they all were as large as life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The women wear a dark bodice with long sleeves, over
which is folded a shawl with a border of gay-coloured
embroidery worked on black silk. The skirt is immensely
full, and often accordion-pleated, and it is worn over half
a dozen petticoats which distend it to the dimensions of a
crinoline, and make the wearer look high waisted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>very stout. It is cut short in front, to display six inches
of red or pink underskirt ornamented with scrolls of black
braid, and on top of all comes a very short bright-coloured
apron, which gives the women a three-decker appearance.
The hair is worn in a plait down the back and smoothly
parted on the forehead, the headkerchief being often
embroidered with gay silk flowers. A heavy gold chain
is sometimes worn round the neck, and the shoes are of
white canvas and resemble Moorish slippers, being turned
up in a point at the toe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men are hardly less picturesque. Their velveteen
trousers of peacock-blue, brown, or purple are cut tight
at the knee and spreading at the foot, like those of our
costers or sailors. The coat of dark-blue cotton is very
short and shaped something like a blouse, being gathered
into pleats at the collar and hanging loose and full all
round. They wear a white shirt with a vivid pink or
blue sash, a broad-brimmed felt hat with ribbons hanging
down behind, and their costume is completed by a fringed
shawl in red and green plaid which they hang round their
neck.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little girls are precise replicas of their mothers—long
skirt, apron, headkerchief and all—so that at a distance
it is impossible to say whether it is a party of
children or of women coming towards one, and it was
often a surprise to see a small matronly figure skip suddenly
across a ditch with an agility beyond her apparent
years.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>When we reached St. Antonio, a village of clean
whitewashed houses, with reefs of bedrock cropping up
in the streets, we got out our camera, and were soon
surrounded by a friendly group of peasants fully as much
interested in our appearance as we were in theirs. Yet
in no way did their curiosity get the better of their
manners. We found them quite willing to be photographed
if we wished it, but the posing of a group was
unaccompanied by any of the bashful giggling with which
our own yokels would meet such a request coming from a
foreigner. Earnest and dignified, quite devoid of self-consciousness,
and not easily moved to mirth, the Ivizans
struck us as the most perfect-mannered people we had
yet met.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mere fact of our being English was a great recommendation
in the eyes of the natives, for the forthcoming
marriage of King Alfonso with an English princess was
of course the topic of the day, and all classes were equally
delighted with the match. As compatriots of their future
Queen we therefore met with an unusually favourable
reception, and though I am sure none of the peasants
had the remotest idea where England was situated we
found a great bond of union to consist in the fact that
both we and they lived on an island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many were the questions we had to answer—Did one
reach England before getting to America? Was England
far from London?</p>

<p class='c013'>One man left his plough to come and tell us that he
liked the English very much, which was a little surprising
when one considered that till that moment he had probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>never set eyes on any one of our nationality. We
heard subsequently, however, that some years ago an
Englishman hailing from Birmingham had stayed in the
island, and though, to our host’s surprise, we could not
supply the unknown traveller’s name, we were shown an
unmistakable proof of his visit in the form of an English
book—the only existing specimen in Iviza.</p>

<p class='c013'>We got back to our inn in time for dinner, and found
the same company again assembled at table. The <i>Fonda
de la Marina</i> is the fashionable restaurant of the town,
and it caters for a considerable <i>clientèle</i> among the residents
in addition to its own guests. The cookery was
doubtless excellent, but the dishes were so wholly native
in character that we perhaps failed to appreciate them as
fully as did our fellow convives. During Holy Week
the fare is <i>maigre</i>, and our <i>menu</i> that night was the
following:—</p>

<p class='c013'>A tureen-full of shellfish, stewed—shells and all—with
rice and fragments of lobster.</p>

<p class='c013'>A mess of pottage, very thick, containing white beans
and cabbage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another mess—chunks of salt cod, with eggs, potatoes
and peas.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whole fishes, boiled, with yellow sauce.</p>

<p class='c013'>A sweet cake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cheese, raisins, and oranges.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>The following morning we drove to Santa Eulália.
There are only two really firstrate roads in Iviza—one to
Sant Antonio, the twelve-mile drive we had already taken,
the other—slightly longer—to San Juan, at the northeastern
extremity of the island; it was in this direction
that we set off at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>The view of the town as we skirted the harbour was
extremely striking. The great sails of the merchantmen
lying at anchor in the bay shone white against the deep
blue sea beyond, and the low sun was catching the angles
of the fortifications and casting cobalt shadows upon the
snowy, irregular houses clustering upon the hill crowned
by the <i>campanile</i> of the cathedral. Market folk were
coming into town—countrywomen in broad be-ribboned
hats of palmito plait, mounted on mules and donkeys
with laden panniers—a sight never seen in Majorca.
Innumerable frogs croaked with jangling grotesque
jollity from hidden reservoirs in the rich <i>huerta</i>, or
garden, of vines and almonds, beans and wheat, through
which we were driving. Presently the road rises, and
winds through pretty wooded slopes and copses of
conifers. Here and there are stacked great heaps of
pine bark, used for tanning the fishing nets. Sheep seek
invisible sustenance upon stony red ground, and young
pigs sport in the shade of budding fig-trees, the prevailing
principle seeming to be to turn beasts out to graze
wherever they will do the least harm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning aside from the main road we take a rough
track leading down to the coast. Very Corot-like is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>landscape before us, framed by the stems of gnarled olive
or dark knotted carob. On a small eminence by the seashore
stands Santa Eulália—a frankly oriental-looking
village of blank white walls and blue shadows, ringed
round with a fence of prickly pear. By a steep zigzag
path one climbs to the old fortress-church upon the
summit, and enters the building through an immense
vaulted and enclosed crypt-like porch, supported on
massive pillars and capable of holding a couple of
hundred people. In the Middle Ages this church, like
most of those in the island, formed the stronghold of the
villagers during the frequent piratical raids, and inside
the porch is the well from which the besieged drew their
water supply.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stepping through a side door one enters the cemetery—a
tiny enclosure upon the hillside, with nameless
wooden crosses half buried in grass and a tangle of
yellow daisies. Here the dead lie, under sunshine and
sea-breezes—and from here the eye ranges far over land
and sea, over wooded hills, undulating red plains, palm-trees
and rocky islets. Commenting upon the beauty of
the scene to our faithful waiter, he admitted that it was
indeed a <em>precious</em> one—a complimentary term which he
applied indiscriminately to views, roads, the weather, or
the condition of the sea—but far more precious, he
hastened to assure us, would be the sight of the river
which we should presently be vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>The river was unfortunately not looking its best, being
very nearly dry; but we duly inspected its rocky bed,
fringed with oleander and dotted with water pools, and
expressed our admiration of the fine stone bridge that
spans it. The pride with which the natives regard their
<i>Rio de Santa Eulália</i> is due to the fact that it is the only
river in the island.</p>

<p class='c013'>We went back to Iviza at racing speed, the little horse
trotting fifteen miles an hour on the flat, and straining
every nerve to raise his average. We feared that it would
over tire him to take us to the Salt Works in the afternoon,
but his owner laughed at the idea, and assured us
that the good little beast would be quite ready to start
again after a two hours’ rest. We were somewhat
amused when, at the end of our stay, we received the bill
for our three long drives—a bill for fifteen pesetas, exactly
the sum that we should have paid for a half-day’s excursion
at Palma, where carriage hire is by no means cheap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The donkey makes out a different bill from the
driver,” says a Minorcan proverb, and whether our little
horse considered his three silver <i>douros</i> an adequate
compensation for the work he had done I cannot say—but
his owner was completely satisfied. The Ivizans are as
yet—and long may they remain so!—too unsophisticated
to charge special prices to a foreigner. A striking instance
of their natural honesty occurred on the night of
our arrival. I had given a <i>peseta</i> to the sailor lad who
had brought down our luggage from the deck of the <i>Isleño</i>
and put it into the boat, and to my surprise he handed
me back the coin at once. Thinking that it was either a
bad one, or that he expected more, I asked our friend who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>was with us in the boat, what I ought to give; but he
replied that the boy had already received threepence from
himself for carrying the luggage, that nothing further was
expected, and that the peseta had been returned because
it was considered too much.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our third and last expedition in Iviza was destined to
be the most enjoyable of all. Our kind friend—whom we
found to be one of the municipal officials of the town—volunteered
to accompany us to the Salt Works, and <i>en
passant</i> to show us the recently-discovered Phœnician
necropolis, in the excavation of which he was deeply
interested. Although it had long been known that the
Phœnicians colonised the Balearics—the very name of
the islands being derived, as some think, from their god
Baal—it is only of late years that actual proofs of their
occupation have been obtained. Iviza was said to have
remained under their sway for a thousand years, and to
have had a capital with a population of a hundred
thousand souls, and the Phœnician cemetery which three
years ago was discovered just outside the town goes far to
substantiate this theory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alighting from our <i>carréta</i> at the foot of a rocky reef
immediately to the south of the town, we climbed the
hillside and reached a grove of ancient olive-trees growing
in the crevices of a great granite outcrop. The whole
hillside is honeycombed with rock tombs—they are
everywhere, on the hill, and on the lower ground—filled
in with earth, built over, planted over; it is the burial
ground of a nation. More than a thousand tombs have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>already been located, and of these some sixty have been
investigated at the cost of two or three Ivizan gentlemen
who are interested in the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general type of tomb is an oblong hole or shaft, cut
in the live rock and descending to a depth of six to eight
feet, whence a low sloping gallery leads to the subterranean
burial chamber. Each chamber contains one, two, or
even three massive stone sarcophagi, made from a kind of
white limestone found on the neighbouring island of
Formentara. Not a tomb has yet been opened but what
it has already been violated—it is presumed by the
Vandals. The heavy sarcophagus lids have been pushed
aside or broken, and any contents of value—if such there
were—long ago abstracted. But of what the Vandals
overlooked or despised, there yet remains enough to rejoice
the heart of an archæologist, and a small museum has
already been created in Iviza for the reception of the finds
as the work of excavation goes on. Bones and skulls,
once clothed in Tyrian purple and fine linen, are collected
and ranged neatly upon shelves. Hundreds of amphoræ
are found, each sarcophagus containing two, placed in a
depression at the feet of the dead, while others seem
to have served as cinerary urns for the remains of
children.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a large collection of red pottery—busts,
statuettes, and masks—some of the latter with an
Egyptian cast of countenance, others of a comic type
with glass or metal rings in the nose. There are some
beautiful tear-bottles of iridescent glass, coloured with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>metallic oxides, and delicate pottery jars for ointment.
There are shallow open oil lamps, shaped like a shell,
and bronze rings and seals. That very day the workmen
had unearthed a pretty ram’s head with curling horns,
of fragile white earthenware, which our friend showed
us. He also had in his possession what I should suppose
to be the most valuable find yet made—an
engraved scarab of dark green hæmatite, comprising
on its tiny surface the figure of a man on horseback,
with a spear in his hand and a dog by his side, the
whole cut with the delicacy of the finest intaglio.</p>

<p class='c013'>No inscriptions have as yet come to light, but as each
tomb is opened the hope revives that it may prove to be
in an unrifled condition and contain something that may
throw a fresh light upon the burial customs of a long-vanished
people. An illustrated pamphlet dealing with
the Ivizan discoveries up to the present was in process
of preparation at the time of our visit, and I much regret
not having received a copy in time to acquaint my reader
with fuller details regarding this necropolis than we were
able to gather during our very brief stay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Continuing our drive to the Salt Works, we pass the
old fortified church of San Jorge, standing alone amongst
the fields, its battlemented walls glistening snow-white
against the distant hills. This church was built in the
fourteenth century, and has withstood many an assault
by the Moors.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Another hour, over a ludicrously bad road, brings us to
the low-lying <i>Salinas</i> near the coast; one might almost
fancy oneself in a miniature Switzerland, for these salt-pans—which
are said to have been known to the
Phœnicians—cover an area of six square miles, and
resemble inland lakes in whose unruffled surface the
surrounding hills are mirrored. There are thirteen
great <i>estancos</i> or shallow basins, fringed with glittering
salt-crystals and intersected by sea-water canals, and
causeways along which a little train puffs breathlessly
towards the shining islands of salt stacked on stone
platforms in the water; filling its trucks—each of which
contains a ton—it hurries back to the embarking station,
and pulling up on a staging running out into the sea,
tips its load down a wooden shoot into a barge below,
where bare-legged men—half salted up—are busy levelling
the white mound, and presently convey it to a big
Norwegian steamer lying in the harbour. Other salt
boats are bound for Russia, or for America. One would
think there was enough salt to supply the whole world;
it lies in deep snowdrifts on the quay and is piled up into
mountains by men who look like black flies beside it.
The busiest time is during the summer, when the water
in the shallow basins evaporates and the deposited salt
is collected, but at that season the locality is considered
unhealthy—the combined heat and moisture breeding
malaria and a plague of mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>By evening light the <i>Salinas</i> are very beautiful. The
colours of the sunset are repeated in the water, and the
dark banks and rushes stand out in sharp-cut silhouette
against the soft purple of the hills around. Out at sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>rises the double fang of the island rock <i>Détra</i>—an
inaccessible pinnacle, in the summit of which the wild
bees have nested from time immemorial; the whole rock
is said to be sticky with honey, which at times descends
in rivulets even to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was dusk when we regained our inn, and at ten
o’clock that same night the red lights of the <i>Isleño</i> were
seen gliding into the bay, and we were summoned to go
on board. Taking leave of our most kind friend—who,
not content with having done the honours of his native
island, insisted upon our accepting some charming
Phœnician relics as souvenirs of our stay—we went
down to the quay and were seen off by our host and
the faithful waiter, the latter remarking, as he shook
hands with us, that we might safely rely upon the
night being a precious one.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sea was indeed like glass. The little steamer lay
within fifty yards of the shore, and not a ripple stirred
as we were rowed across in company with a tunny boat
just in from Formentara—the fish standing on their
heads in baskets on the deck, their big tails sticking
up like ammunition for some torpedo boat. On an even
keel we glided out into the night, and awoke at five the
next morning to see the red watch tower of Porto Pi
slip past the port hole. A fiery dawn was breaking over
Palma as we went on shore; half a silver moon hung
in the sky, and the masts and rigging of the shipping
in the harbour were cut like a fine etching against the
colourless mass of the town.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Even at this early hour the day’s work had begun;
scavengers’ carts were going their rounds; yawning
octroi men were astir; women were already fetching
water from the tortoise-fountain on the Borne, and as
we reached the hotel a belated watchman was making
off with lantern and staff, to hide in some quiet retreat
till dusk again brought him out to his bat-like life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our visit to Iviza was already a thing of the past, but
the little island that had before been only a name to us
was now a very definite memory of pleasant days spent
in the open air, of friendly and picturesque natives,
of sunshine and charming scenery—while even our
unpropitious landing had turned out to be a blessing
in disguise, in acquainting us with the resident whose
kindness contributed so largely to the pleasant recollections
which we shall always retain of our stay
in Iviza.</p>

  <h2 id='ch4' class='c004'>PART IV<br /> <br /><span class='large'>MINORCA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c012'>April was now nearly over and our holiday in the
Balearics was drawing to its close. We had seen
Majorca pretty thoroughly, we had had a charming
glimpse of Iviza, and it only remained to spend a few
days in Minorca to complete our tour of the islands. For
fifty pesetas two first-class passages were secured for us
on the <i>Isla de Menorca</i>, leaving Palma on April 26th, and
at half-past six that evening we went on board, prepared
to endure the eleven hours’ crossing to Port Mahon.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the last it was doubtful whether the boat would
start that night; a high west wind was blowing, the
bay was flecked with white horses, and the clothes
hung out on the housetops were clapping wildly, as if
in exultation. But start we eventually did—perhaps
owing to the fact that the Governor of the Balearics
was on board, a personage of sufficient importance to
allay any apprehension on our part as to the voyage,
and indeed to act as a practical guarantee of safety,
since, though the wind and the waves may be no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>respecters of persons, it remains an undoubted fact
that governors of provinces get drowned far less frequently
than do obscure individuals.</p>

<p class='c013'>At half-past five the following morning we entered
the famous Minorcan port, and steamed up it for three
miles before sighting Mahon, which occupies a commanding
position on the edge of the precipitous rock
walls of the harbour. Disembarking at a little quay
below the town, we confided our valises to a porter
and followed him up a steep, cobbled street to the Hotel
Bustamante, a very respectable inn in the higher quarter,
where we were promptly accommodated with rooms and
board at a <i>pension</i> of six pesetas a day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seen at close quarters, Mahon is singularly uninteresting
and commonplace. If the architecture of
Palma is essentially Spanish, and that of Iviza Moorish,
Mahon must be put down as painfully and typically
English. The long, straight streets of ugly houses,
without balconies or outside shutters, the dreary vistas
of grey cobbles and foot pavements recall the outskirts
of one of our own manufacturing towns; there are the
same mean-looking painted street doors, the same sash
windows, even the same lace curtains inside. We were
shown the exercise ground, with its row of British-built
barracks, the hideous Paséo, or Promenade, which
resembles a cinder track, and the favourite drive along
the harbour, a dismally unattractive road. The sole
trace of the picturesque that the town can lay claim to
consists of one small fragment of the old fortifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>that spans a modern street—a turreted archway known
as Barbarossa’s Gate, in memory of the corsair who
sacked the city in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inhabitants of Mahon share the general commonplaceness
of their surroundings. They have neither the
dignified bearing of the Majorcans nor their good looks;
the men are not clean shaven like those of the other
islands, but wear beards, and sometimes whiskers. The
style of dress is also very inferior, and here and there
we met with signs of actual untidiness among the
women—frowsy heads and ill-fitting blouses, such as we
had not set eyes on since landing in the Balearics.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something of this lack of personal neatness may
perhaps be set down to the tempestuous winds from
which Mahon suffers almost perpetually, and which
nearly tore our hats from our heads and our clothes
from our backs as we drove out towards the mouth of
the harbour to visit the ruined fortress of San Felípe.
San Felípe is a strong position commanding the approach
to Port Mahon upon the southern side, and it played
an important part in the English occupation of Minorca.
Twice captured by the British and twice retaken, it
fell for the second time in the year 1782, when General
Murray was forced to capitulate to a combined French
and Spanish force under De Crillon, after a long and
tedious siege which the allies had hoped to avoid by the
offer of a bribe of £100,000 to the English general.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was during this siege that the cook of the Duc de
Crillon earned for himself undying fame by inventing as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>an adjunct to his master’s salads the sauce termed
<i>Mahonnaise</i>—the familiar mayonnaise of all cookery
books to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>We had hoped to find objects of pictorial as well as
sentimental value among the ruined fortifications, rock
galleries, and nameless British graves at San Felípe,
of which the guide book speaks, but our hopes were
destined to be rudely dashed, for after a most uninteresting
drive of a couple of miles between untidy stone walls
we were unceremoniously stopped by a sentry, who
informed us that no one was allowed to approach the
fort without a permit from the commandant of Mahon.
For our consolation he added that in any case there
was nothing to be seen, as the ruins of the old fort
had been replaced by modern defence works. A more
unpicturesque scene could indeed hardly be imagined
than the site of San Felípe now presents—a bleak headland
traversed by long lines of masonry and intersecting
trenches, with grass-grown embankments sloping down
to the old sea wall on the side of the harbour, from
whence one looks across to the new fortress built on the
opposite peninsula.</p>

<p class='c013'>Disappointed, we retraced our steps. It was now
evident that neither Mahon nor its immediate surroundings
would produce anything that need detain us in
the town, and we decided to set out without further
delay in search of those relics of a far older occupation
than that of the British—the menhirs and dolmens of a
pre-historic race.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>These megalithic remains—of which there are said
to be some two hundred groups in all—are found
scattered over the whole of the southern half of the
island; but the average traveller will be wise to confine
himself to those specimens only which present most
perfectly the different types of monument erected, <i>i.e.</i>,
the tumulus or talayót, the altar, the enclosure of
monoliths, and the megalithic dwelling. Some of the
finest specimens of all occur in the neighbourhood of
Mahon itself, and can be visited in the course of a drive
extending over some four hours. Acting on the recommendation
of our very friendly host we chartered a
<i>galaréta</i> driven by a swarthy native who knew the
country thoroughly. Our host, to our great surprise,
spoke very fair English, and even our driver could say
“Yes,” which was a great advance upon anything we had
yet met with.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is singular that although so many English customs
and traditions have survived amongst the Mahonese—who
are dubbed <i>Inglesos</i> by the rest of the island—yet
the only island to agree with ourselves in its rule of the
road should be Majorca, both Minorca and Iviza following
the opposite and continental fashion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mounting our <i>galaréta</i> we bumped and crashed away
over the worn paving of the town and emerged by the
Barbarossa gate into the open country. The surroundings
of Mahon are not beautiful; flat, windswept, and practically
treeless, save where a stunted olive-tree hunches its
back to the blast, the most conspicuous feature of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>landscape is its countless miles of stone walls. If we had
thought Majorca stony, it was only because we had not
seen Minorca. Majorca is a land of fields intersected by
walls—Minorca a land of walls interspersed with fields.
Once off the high road one becomes involved in a labyrinth
of narrow lanes bordered by stone walls four or five
feet thick, and varying in height from six to ten feet,
between which one wanders as in an overgrown aqueduct.
Every field, however small—and some of them are patches
but a few yards square—is enclosed by a prodigious
rampart of loose stones, within which cows and donkeys
graze as though at the bottom of a quarry. These walls
serve a double purpose in sheltering the crops and the
animals from the wind, and in relieving the land of a
certain proportion of superabundant stone.</p>

<p class='c013'>As may be imagined, a cross-country tramp in Minorca
is attended with considerable difficulty, and in visiting the
talayóts it is essential to have a guide who knows his
way about and who can direct one through the maze of
obstacles that has to be threaded in attaining some
tumulus that rises like a landmark half a mile away.
Much of the land is under wheat—the crop much behind
that of Majorca—and this has to be carefully skirted, or
waded through with an eye to the barest patches of
ground; other fields are devoted to pasture, where handsome
mauve thistles flourish abundantly in the rocky soil,
in company with periwinkles, borage, yellow daisies,
white clover, and sweet alyssum. As a rule the enclosures
can be entered and quitted by the <i>barréras</i>—light wooden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>barriers kept in place by blocks of stone and removed for
the passage of cattle; but occasionally we were obliged to
scale the walls by means of projecting footholds built into
their sides, whereat spotted cows ceased grazing, to gaze
with mild surprise at the unusual spectacle of two ladies
performing gymnastic feats in company with a camera
and tripod.</p>

<p class='c013'>A quarter of an hour’s arduous progression brought us
to the <i>talayót</i> of Trepúco, said to be one of the largest in
the island, but by no means that in the best preservation.
The Minorcan <i>talayóts</i>—a word akin to <i>atalaya</i>, a watch-tower—consist
of solid cone-shaped cairns built of roughly
dressed stone blocks, often of gigantic size. These cairns
range from thirty to sixty feet in diameter, and from
twenty to thirty feet in height; but at close quarters they
are far less conspicuous objects than might be supposed,
partly owing to their general resemblance to the stone
walls surrounding them, and partly to the enveloping scrub
of lentiscus and oleaster which conceals their outline and
lends them the appearance of a natural mound. Some of
them are in an extremely dilapidated condition—others
again, like the <i>talayót</i> of Toréllo of which a picture is given,
are in almost perfect preservation. It is supposed that
they are the burial cairns of chieftains, but though cinerary
urns are said to have been found inside them in one or
two instances, this theory alone does not satisfactorily
account for other features of these curious monuments.
In some of them traces of interior chambers have been
discovered, others have a sloping ramp running round the
outside as a means of ascent, and the <i>talayót</i> of Toréllo
has an aperture like a window, on a level with the summit
of the mound, the reason of which it is impossible to
guess.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Not one of these tumuli has, I believe, yet been
properly examined, and their purpose—whether sepulchre,
watch-tower, refuge, or accessory to some strange
religious rite—is still a secret, though the latter supposition
finds support in the fact that where there is a
<i>talayót</i> there is in many cases an altar in its immediate
vicinity. These altars or <i>mésas</i>—tables, as the natives
call them—are composed of two gigantic slabs of dressed
stone, the one imbedded in an upright position in the
ground, the other balanced horizontally upon it. The
altar of Trepúco consists of two fine monoliths, the lower
one measuring nearly nine feet in width and standing
over seven feet out of the ground; but that of the Taláto-de-Dalt
far exceeds these measurements, the upright slab
being nearer twelve feet in height and proportionately
wide. When the upper stone had been laid in its horizontal
position it was apparently considered ill-balanced, and
a prop has been added in the shape of a leaning slab
surmounted by a wedge. The group of monuments at
this spot is the most complete that will be found in
Minorca; the tumulus itself is in a chaotic state, but the
altar is of unusual size, and surrounding it are seen traces
of a circle of monoliths of nearly the same height as the
pedestal. Just outside this enclosure is a so-called
megalithic dwelling into which one can creep on hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and knees; the walls are of rough stone, and two short,
thick pillars, about three feet high, uphold the large slabs
that form the roof. The members of the priesthood—if
such they were who tenanted these modest habitations—certainly
did not err on the side of luxury in their homes.</p>

<p class='c013'>In few countries perhaps would the splendid monoliths
of these altars and the tempting quarries of building
material provided by these <i>talayóts</i> have survived
destruction as they have in Minorca. The very profusion
of stone, constituting not merely a drug but a
curse throughout the island, has safeguarded these old
monuments more effectually than any protection founded
on sentiment could have done, for it has simply never
been worth anybody’s while to utilise them.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the Minorcan country-folk live in excellent stone
houses, as might be supposed, and before leaving the
island we had the opportunity of visiting a solitary
outlying homestead tenanted by a peasant family of a
superior class. Although we were fully prepared to find
signs of homely comfort in the dwellings of so industrious
a people as the Minorcans, yet it was a surprise to see
how excellent—not to say luxurious—were the appointments
of this house. Not a room but was better
furnished than those of any <i>fonda</i> at which we had
stayed. The spacious bedrooms had handsome bedsteads,
large wardrobes—an article of furniture never
seen in Majorca—and one of them actually contained
a fine toilet-table <i>à l’Anglaise</i>, with a marble top and
sets of small drawers.  The daughter of the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>showed us the kitchen, the dairy—with its big white
cheeses destined for the Mahon market—and then
she took us upstairs to the attics, where hanks of homespun
yarn hung from the ceiling in company with
hundreds of dried sausages and home-cured hams. In
one small and otherwise empty room were half a dozen
faggots carefully propped together in the centre of the
floor within a ring of sheeps’ wool—a scene so suggestive
of sorcery that our thoughts involuntarily turned to
some magic rite connected with the mysterious cromlechs
of the land. But the girl informed us that this was a
depôt for live stock destined for the table—and pointing
out myriads of snails adhering to the sticks she assured
us that they were very excellent eating when fried.</p>

<p class='c013'>The neatness and spotlessness of the whole place it
would be impossible to exaggerate. The Minorcan
housewife is popularly supposed to live with a broom
in one hand and a pail of whitewash in the other, and
the industry and morality of the islanders make them
valued colonists in any land to which they may emigrate.
Early trained to habits of thrift and diligent labour in
a hard school, the peasants have no sympathy with
those who think to sit under the <i>mañana</i> tree and yet
to prosper, and the tragic fate awaiting them is thus
recorded in an ancient Minorcan verse:</p>

<p class='c013'>On April 28th we left Mahon and went to Ciudadéla
on the west coast, the town which formed the capital of
Minorca up to the time of the English occupation. The
two towns are connected by a splendid road that runs
through the very centre of the island; and as the distance
is little more than thirty miles the journey can easily be
accomplished by carriage in a day. We started at nine
o’clock in our <i>galaréta</i> of the previous day; our valises
were bestowed upon the front seat beside the driver, and
we ourselves climbed into the closed part of the vehicle at
the back, not sorry to be sheltered from the wind. We
had an excellent mule, both strong and active, who trotted
briskly on the flat and pegged away up the hills as though
walking for a wager—a characteristic which we observed
most of the mules to share.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaving the town we bowled away along the great
main road of the island. Seen in the brilliant sunshine
of an April morning, with a blue sky overhead, green
crops in the fields and wild flowers spangling the wayside,
even the country around Mahon becomes invested with
a kind of fictitious beauty; but what the hideous desolation
must be of these endless stone walls seen on a grey
winter’s day or under the parching drought of summer it
is hardly possible to conceive.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“When the North wind goes down the West wind is
already knocking at the door,” says a Minorcan proverb,
and the few trees that grow in these exposed regions are
driven to the most ridiculous subterfuges in their endeavours
to protect their foliage from the blasts that sweep
for ever across the island. The prevailing tree is the
oleaster, or wild olive, which turns its back to the north,
and with bent stem and long hair all blown in one direction
assumes as nearly as possible the appearance of an
attenuated crumb-brush. Some of the trees are absolutely
ludicrous in their contortions, and we could not help
laughing at the sight of a whole row of them growing
beside a low stone wall, over which they had flung themselves
in their attempts to escape; falling on their hands
and knees, so to speak, in the next field, they had picked
themselves up again and gone on running, leaving their
roots and trunks on the farther side of the wall—quite
content so long as the very tips of their branches remained
alive and out of reach of the dreaded north wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the seventh kilometre stone out of Mahon our driver
pulled up, and tying the mule to a gate, he led us across
a field to show us what he called a <i>bonito casito</i>—a good
little house—built by megalithic man.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the base of a ruined <i>talayót</i> constructed of enormous
stones and overgrown with ivy, we saw a small opening,
about a yard in height, leading into a low passage some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>eight feet long, at the further end of which is a still
smaller doorway, measuring only two feet six inches by
two feet. Once through this, however, one enters a
palatial abode not less than twenty feet long, seven wide,
and nine high—which, although it will hardly bear comparison
in point of grandeur with the stone dwellings
built by the Minorcans nowadays for their pigs, was yet
so immeasurably superior to the modest priestly dwelling
of Taláto-de-Dalt that we concluded that we were looking
upon the residence of none other than the arch-druid or
high-priest himself—and that it was through this very
doorway that the venerable personage used to emerge on
all fours, robed in full canonicals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the <i>talayóts</i> that we examined this is the only one
that contained an inner chamber of any size, most of the
so-called megalithic dwellings consisting of small cavities
or recesses that can only by a stretch of imagination be
supposed to have served as human habitations.</p>

<p class='c013'>As one approaches the centre of the island the most
conspicuous object in the level landscape is the conical
outline of Monte Toro, a mere molehill less than twelve
hundred feet in height, but raised to the dignity of a
mountain from the accident of having no rival in Minorca.
Upon its summit is seen the large convent and church
of the Augustines, a place of pilgrimage for the islanders.
At noon we arrived at Mercadél, a tidy and commonplace
little village forming a half-way house between Mahon
and Ciudadéla, and here we put up for a couple of hours
to rest and have luncheon. The Governor of the Balearics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>who was making the tour of Minorca in a steam diligence,
arrived almost immediately after ourselves, and from our
window we could watch him being received in the street
by the local officials, between whom and the governor’s
suite there was much hat raising and clapping on the
back—the latter form of greeting being carried out
mutually and simultaneously by both persons concerned,
with a peculiarly genial and happy effect. The governor’s
steam diligence overtook us again before we reached
Ciudadéla, and our mule, taking its snorting and rattling
as a challenge, responded by racing it frantically along the
high road for more than a mile before he would admit
himself beaten.</p>

<p class='c013'>On leaving Mercadél we made a <i>détour</i> to the south by
way of San Cristobal, an hour distant, where Murray’s
guide-book asserts that certain “fine and curious <i>talayóts</i>”
are to be found. Our search for these, however,
proved a wildgoose chase, for all our questioning of the
villagers produced nothing beyond four quite unimportant
tumuli, difficult of access and in no way worth visiting—our
driver remarking severely that he knew all along it
would be so, since if he had not heard of the monuments
we were in quest of it was quite certain they did not
exist. In spite of this crushing observation we were not
altogether sorry to have come to San Cristobal, for the
road passes through the prettiest country we had yet seen
in Minorca, undulating hills wooded with pine and ilex,
and ditches full of a handsome flowering reed not unlike
a small Pampas grass.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>At Ferrerías, where we rejoined the high road, the whole
soil is so impregnated with iron that at a little distance
one might have imagined the landscape to be tinted by a
Swiss <i>Alpenglūth</i>—the ruddy hillsides and the dark red
of the stone walls harmonising strikingly with the crimson
flower of a sheet of sainfoin in the foreground. The
western side of the island is in general more hilly and
more timbered than the eastern coast, some clumps of tall
Aleppo pines forming picturesque features in the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>When within a couple of miles of Ciudadéla our driver
drew up, and pointed out to us a large grey mass lying in
a field some little distance from the road. This was the
<i>Nau de Tudons</i>, one of the most remarkable monuments
in the island, which our guide was particularly anxious to
show us; but after getting down and wrestling for a few
moments with a high field-gate he returned crestfallen to
the carriage to say that the gate was locked, and that it
would, unfortunately, not be possible for the señoras to
visit the Nau, as there was no other way of approach.
Assuring him loftily that locked gates were as nothing in
our eyes we got over it, to his great astonishment, and
made our way across the fields towards a strange erection
unlike any other we had hitherto seen.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The Nau de Tudons—<i>nau</i> is the patois for boat—is
composed of enormous blocks of stone and built in the
form of an upturned boat about thirty feet in length and
twelve in height. The rounded bow points to the north,
and at the base of the square stern is a so-called
dwelling—a retreat barely large enough to accommodate
a human being. It is supposed that the interior of the
Nau itself served originally as a habitation, for the
centre is partially hollow and is roofed over with gigantic
slabs, most of which have now fallen in. There is something
strangely pathetic about this old monument raised
by a long vanished race that has left memorials of
imperishable stone without a sign or a word to record
who the builders were or whence they came. Mysterious
and lonely the Nau stands out against the sunset sky;
a couple of donkeys graze amongst clumps of spurge and
asphodel, and a stonechat chacks sharply from the
topmost slab of the roof; but the tide of human life has
long receded from the spot—never to return.</p>

<p class='c013'>At seven o’clock we reached Ciudadéla and drew up at
the Fonda Feliciano in the Plaza Alfonso III. The
sunset had cast such a glamour of crimson and gold over
the white city on the seashore that we were a little
disappointed to find it so essentially unromantic-looking
at close quarters, but any haven was welcome after seven
hours’ shaking in a <i>galaréta</i>. We found the inn to be
chiefly frequented by persons of the class—as far as we
could judge—of commercial travellers, several of whom
dined at the <i>table d’hôte</i> that evening. The fare was
ample, but the cookery far more greasy and less refined
than in Majorca; the strangest medley of eatables made
its appearance on the dish sometimes—the beef being
garnished with potatoes, fat bacon, hunks of stewed
cabbage, <i>garbanzos</i>—enormous white beans—aniseed
cake, and goodness knows what besides, so that during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>one course we had nine different things on our plate at
once, to only five of which could we put a name. Being
very tired we went to bed early, our host informing us
in bad English as he lighted us upstairs that as the inn
was very full he could not give us a second bedroom till
the following day. The fact that the house was being
rebuilt, and that we should be waked at five o’clock by
workmen pulling down a floor overhead, he prudently left
us to find out for ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are several excursions to be made from Ciudadéla,
and the two days we spent there were amply
occupied in visiting the principal megalithic remains in
the neighbourhood. The <i>talayóts</i> of Hostal which
Murray’s guide-book mentions, we found uninteresting,
besides being troublesome to get to—much traversing of
rocky wheatfields and stone walls being necessary before
reaching them. But the drive to Torre Trencáda is
well worth taking, and can be combined with a visit
to Llafúda.</p>

<p class='c013'>Starting at nine o’clock, we retraced our steps along
the high road for a few miles and then turned off sharply
by a cart track leading across the fields. The pastures
were studded with outcrops of live rock turned to gold by
a brilliant orange-coloured lichen, and innumerable tiny
field flowers, red and blue pimpernels, vetches, and a
minute orange marigold, spread a gay little carpet under
foot. The common daisy of the Balearics is not the
crimson-tipped flower of our lawns, though quite as wee
and modest; it is a more fragile plant, and its flower has
a faint mauve tinge which on being dried becomes a
bright blue. A friend of ours at Kew told us it was the
<i>Bellium bellidioides</i> of Linnæus.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>A short walk brought us to the altar of Torre Trencádo,
which is a very fine one. The horizontal stone has in
its lower surface a clean cut socket which receives the
head of the upright slab, but in spite of this it has
needed additional support in the shape of a pillar and
wedge like the <i>mésa</i> at Taláto-de-Dalt. One would give
much to penetrate the secret of this old-world altar
standing in its great solitude, wrapped in the silence of
the ages. For what strange worship of sun or moon
was it erected? What implacable deity demanded a
human sacrifice? Does the spirit of priest or victim
ever haunt the lonely monument at twilight and hovering
around the symbol of an out-worn faith realise that
the gods themselves have passed away in the <i>Götterdämmerung</i>
that has descended upon the land?</p>

<p class='c013'>The monuments at Llafúda, although exceedingly
extensive, are in a state of chaotic ruin, the monoliths
lying in confusion as though flung to the ground by an
earthquake. The position is partially encircled by an
immense stone wall, ten feet in height, in which are
built two or three small megalithic dwellings. This wall
is absolutely typical of those built at the present day by
the Minorcans, barring the fact that its thickness is in
places not less than fifteen feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the neighbouring <i>talayót</i> a fine view over the
surrounding country is obtained—even the faint blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>mountains of Majorca being visible across the water.
I had a somewhat ludicrous <i>rencontre</i> upon the summit
of the cairn, for just as I reached the top I came face to
face with a big brown and white buzzard who was
skimming over it from the opposite side. It would be
hard to say which of us was the most startled; we both
stepped back hurriedly, but the great bird was so close
that I felt the wind of his wings in my face and could see
his magnificent golden eyes dilate as for one moment he
hung motionless, with yellow claws upturned, before he
swung round and with one convulsive flap was gone.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>One of the pleasantest drives in the neighbourhood of
Ciudadéla is to Son Saura, an estate about six miles
distant belonging to a Minorcan nobleman. On this
occasion we drove out <i>en famille</i>, for being Sunday afternoon
not only was the waiter sent with us to enjoy an
outing, but we were begged by our hostess to allow little
José, aged six, to be of the party. Little José was
weeping dismally on the doorstep at the moment, but as
soon as our consent was given his tears stopped instantaneously,
and he was hoisted on to the box seat next the
waiter, under whose charge he was put. His mother
assured us that he would be good—but we had already
seen quite enough of Master José to discount this statement.
Our hostess appeared to have no sort of authority
over her children; she would rave and shriek at them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and occasionally reduce them to tears, but in the end
they invariably got their own way, and their attitude
towards her was entirely that of the little girl in an old
Minorcan nursery couplet which for simplicity and
impertinence it would be hard to surpass:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Mother says to her:</div>
      <div class='line'>Dirty one! Badly brought-up one!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And she answers:</div>
      <div class='line'>You! You were the same!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>I may add at once that little José did not belie his
character. He snatched flowers from the flower beds,
trampled mercilessly on precious young tobacco plants
in crossing the fields, nearly fell into a large reservoir,
was hauled hurriedly over two walls at the imminent
risk of overthrowing a whole row of his elders and
betters, perilously balanced on the top—and in fact
acted as a complete antidote to any pleasure which the
poor harassed waiter might otherwise have derived
from the expedition. We, not being responsible for
the child, took his misdoings less to heart, and when
he temporarily disappeared in the vicinity of an open
reservoir we were able to search the surface of the
water for bubbles with comparative calm—confident
that Master José’s career had not been such as to arouse
the jealousy of the gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Son Saura is a pleasant-looking house surrounded
by a large garden of geraniums and verbenas, roses and
lilacs, all in bloom at the time of our visit. The estate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>is laid out with orange groves, olive and vine yards,
corn and tobacco plantations, the whole admirably
irrigated from two immense central reservoirs. In
summer water has to be sought at a great depth in
Minorca, and the wells being too deep for the employment
of the Persian wheel, the usual method of raising
the water is by means of a large windlass turned by a
donkey—one bucket being let down as the other is
wound up to the top. The drinking troughs for beasts
which stand beside these wells partake of the archaic
simplicity and durability of the dolmens, being formed
of ponderous stone blocks hollowed out to the required
depth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The modern Minorcan has indeed sundry habits not
unworthy of the megalithic monuments of his predecessors.
The stones which he builds into his field walls
are hardly less vast than theirs, and the palaces he
erects for his pigs bear a strong family likeness to the
prehistoric <i>talayót</i>; composed entirely of loose stones,
with a cleverly domed roof, these buildings form quite
a feature of the landscape in many parts of the island.
The smaller ones are often plain huts, but the larger
ones almost always have tastefully ornamented roofs—some
resembling the step pyramids of Sakkára, others
being built in round tiers like a gigantic wedding-cake.
One—by no means the largest—which we entered at
Son Saura, and of which a picture is given, measured
not less than twenty feet across, inside, and twelve or
fifteen feet in height; spacious, clean, and delightfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>cool in hot weather, these houses are used by the pigs
of Minorca as sleeping quarters at night and lounges
at midday. Any attempt to photograph the occupants
we found, however, to be out of the question: the very
sight of a camera filled them with suspicion, and when
this was followed by a strategic advance their worst fears
were confirmed—with volleys of shrieks they broke up
in panic, and, with ears flapping wildly, went off helter
skelter with all the <em>abandon</em> of their Gadarene ancestors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Acting as a kind of pylon to the above-mentioned
palace at Son Saura is a curious old <i>mésa</i>, unlike any
other we saw in the island—the horizontal slab being
supported on <em>two</em> upright pillars, each of which has
a rude capital formed by a separate stone. This monument
is possibly of a different date from the other altars,
and is said to be of a pattern of which—as far as is
known—only one other specimen exists, in the island
of Malta.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last expedition we made at Ciudadéla was to visit
the rock dwellings at Son Moréll—a large property about
an hour distant from the town. There are three farmhouses
upon the estate, at the first of which one naturally
draws up to inquire the way, and unless the traveller
is very careful he will here be taken to see two wholly
unimportant tumuli lying at some distance away amongst
stone walls and a waste of asphodel—the peasants being
convinced that to lead a foreigner to the nearest <i>talayót</i>
is the surest way of making him happy. In all good
faith we followed an ancient man across the fields, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>in due course reached the <i>talayóts</i>; it was quite useless
to explain to our guide that it was not such as these
we were in search of, since besides being very deaf he
understood no word of Castillian, and when we remarked
that the wind was very high he replied by telling us that
he was seventy-eight in January.</p>

<p class='c013'>After much useless tramping and waste of time we
at last discovered that it was <i>Son Morell de Barránco</i> to
which we ought to have driven—the Barranco being
the ravine containing the rock dwellings—and continuing
our route across the fields we presently came to the
second farm, lying within a few minutes’ walk of the
coast. Leaving the carriage here, we descended on foot
towards the sea, and soon came upon a row of curious
dwellings excavated in the rock walls of a narrow valley.
Three of the caves are of considerable size, and in the
one of which we took a photograph a pillar of live rock
is left in the centre to support the roof. All have neatly
cut doorways and windows, and one of the house fronts,
as will be seen, shows traces of decoration—a cornice
and a couple of fluted pilasters having been rudely
chiselled in the face of the rock. Sheep and goats now
inhabit the caves; of the people who with patient labour
constructed their dwellings in this wild and lonely ravine
by the sea no memory remains.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On the 1st of May we left Ciudadéla and returned
to Mahon, stopping for luncheon at the little town of
Alayór, just off the main road. Seen from a distance
Alayór is a veritable fairy city set upon a hill—glistening
snow white in the sunshine—and though at close quarters
it is no longer beautiful, the whiteness of the houses is
so dazzling that it is like passing through snow-cuttings
to drive through the streets, and we were glad of the
green glass panes of our <i>galaréta</i> to protect our eyes
from the blinding glare. Whitewash is indeed a mania
among the Minorcans, who, not content with applying it
to the outer and inner walls of their houses, extend it to
the tiles on the roof, the gutters, chimneys, outhouses,
and even neighbouring rocks. Where the field walls are
coped with freestone this also is whitened for miles,
which gives the landscape the curious and misleading
effect of being traversed in every direction by high
roads.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Within half an hour’s drive of Alayór is the <i>mésa</i> of
Torralba—one of the largest in the island, though it
loses in effect by being encumbered about the base by
bushes and <i>débris</i>. The horizontal stone is said to have
a square cavity in its upper surface, as though to contain
the blood of a victim; but as our outfit did not include a
ladder we were obliged to take this statement on trust.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the sudden storms, for which Minorca is noted,
overtook us while we were engaged in photographing
the altar. The sky darkened, and without a moment’s
warning such a deluge of rain descended that we were
quite unable to regain our carriage, not twenty yards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>distant. The ground was swimming, the bushes and
long grass were drenched, and when ten minutes later
the sun came out again and all was smiles, the only dry
member of the party was the camera—who with his usual
foresight had enveloped himself in the one waterproof
cape at the very beginning of the rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>A couple of hours later we were again in Mahon, and
at five o’clock that same afternoon we had boarded the
Palma boat and were taking our last look at the town as
we glided out of the bay—past the flat green tray of
Hospital Island, past the little rocky hump of Rat Island,
where some fishermen wave to us as their boat rocks
on our swell—past the ruined pepper-pot tower on the
Philipet promontory—past the old sea walls of San
Felipe and the bristling defences of the Isabella fortress
opposite—and as we enter the open sea a chill wind
springs up.</p>

<p class='c013'>At daybreak we land once more—and for the last time—at
the now familiar quay at Palma, and are rattled
through the streets that three short months ago were
new and strange of aspect in our eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our holiday in the south is over. It is the first week
of May: strawberries and cherries are in the market, and
the voice of the cuckoo is heard in the land. The pigeons
are wheeling in flocks around the sunlit tower of San
Nicolas, and myriads of swifts still weave their tireless
flight over the town. But the swallows have gone
northwards, and we must follow them. Two busy days
are spent in packing and in final arrangements for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>return home; and on the 5th of May we board the
<i>Miramar</i> for Barcelona.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a marvellously lovely evening. The wide plain
is wrapped in shimmering shades of pink and violet,
and brilliant against the deep cobalt of the Sierra
stand out the white houses of the town. Cutting the
western horizon in dark silhouette are the wooded slopes
of Bellver—the castle arch spanning a glowing fragment
of the sunset where the gules and or of Aragon are once
more blazoned in the sky. The harbour is a sheet of
gold, and across the ever widening stretch of water
Palma has already dwindled to a doll’s city, where the
great cathedral is the last object on which our eyes
linger. A spark breaks out on the old Moorish tower as
we glide past Porto Pi, some soldiers wave a last goodbye
from the earthworks of San Carlos, the darkening
mountain slopes recede as we reach the portal of Cala
Figuéra—and at last we are clear of the bay of Palma.</p>

<p class='c013'>A golden moon hangs in the indigo vault above us, and
our wake cleaves a shining path straight up to the old
white city that is vanishing from our sight. And passing
out into the night on a sea of glass we half expect to
hear once more the solemn midnight cry—</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
